382,"BJ's has an impressive amount of, well, stuff. This big-box store has just about everything you need, and then some. Clothes, furniture, food, you name it. There are only 2 of us, but we still manage to buy enough to more than pay for our annual membership. Some of our best savings come from the produce, deli meats (super cheap!!!) and the paper goods. The monthly coupon book they send (also available on-site) yields additional savings. You will also find deep discounts on clothes, vitamins, books and DVDs. We rarely have to wait in line for more than a few minutes, and the self check out is very convenient. This store is reasonably clean, albeit a little dingy. (I've seen a lot worse in these stores), The employees have always seemed friendly. 3 stars for not having fresh-made (on-site) items like its competitors (this is not a deterrent for me), and for always having a nagging salesperson when you walk in. No, really, I still don't want Direct TV. Thank you. The shopping carts could also use some serious maintenance.",2
33947,Just had to deal with one of my pet peeves: Horrible Customer Service. Felt discriminated when I walked into a restaurant and immediately noticed there was no where I could park my stroller to sit down and eat with Emily; The lady at the counter rushed me to give my order and was very rude. I moved furniture around to sit while I waited and saw that they stored all of the high chairs in a corner with boxes stacked on top of them! And they obviously didn't want us to stay when they made our order to-go! UGH. Why did I even bother?!,0
36181,"Pleasantly surprised! I have layovers in Charlotte almost every week but was too hesitant to try until yesterday (I knew I was about to face another week of trying to live off of omelets and Burger King salads in Tallahassee because I refuse to eat fried chicken and grits... yes that is all they serve here). Menu is nothing spectacular, but has all the basics. I ordered 2 salmon rolls and edamame. Salmon was fresh and the rice was perfect. Edamame was... edamame. Servers were extremely nice and helpful (although that could just be because I'm in no way accustomed to southern hospitality). Expect to pay $1-2 more per roll than you would if you were A) not in an airport, and B) not in Charlotte, NC.",2
37495,"Sprouts is a great market. Their produce is generally very good. They often will let you sample it for quality. They have a lot of bulk product (grains, peanuts, granola, chocolate morsels, etc). And they feature a lot of canned/packaged processed organic/natural products like soups and stocks, sauces and salsas, etc. They also have bulk spice section where they sell by the ounce. And they feature natural sodas that use real sugar instead of that corn syrup poison. Not as much variety as a supermarket, but still a good variety of good quality stuff.",3
30090,"honestly the food is impeccable. if you're going for the \""Vegas\"" feel where they give you amazing service, you are going to the wrong place. ate here 3 times, took combined HOURS to wait for food, drinks, check, etc. some of the servers are seriously on so much Xanax I could a contact buzz. food, amazing, but not worth the crap you have to deal with to get a refill or some warm bread. go somewhere else if you wanna be treated well.",0
4493,"worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce. My husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was \""combo?\"" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said \""well just this once\"". No apology, no customer service . I would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back.",0
34125,"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive. Overall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still. Sampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish. Even though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats.",3
1074,"When going here before a Diamondback game, don't expect fast service. Sure, they are trying to do all they can, but dang - there are a LOT of you! Suns games are pretty bad too, though when comparing sold out games, there are just more Diamondback folks trying to get in. The nice thing is, Suns fans want to get out of there and head over before tip off. Most Baseball fans will head over where whenever they're done because they know they have a good 8 hours to go. Ok, lots of sports detail I know. But w/ Jackson's on 3rd, it's all about Sports. If you're thinking of heading over, check the sports schedules in the area before you make any firm plans. Besides that - huge bar. When it's empty (a non-game day) it seems even bigger. But that can work great if you want to meet a crowd there for a non-sports event. The dance club space has been a bit more hit and miss over the years. It went from lame to cool to not so hot to, well maybe if we're in the area anyhow... Who knows where it will be when you go, but it's a decent sized space, a big bar and a good amount of seating so you'll definitely get your drink on, even if you don't get your groove on.",2
20020,"It's no secret that Fed Ex sucked the life out of Kinkos. The BF tells me stories of his youth here and I can see it in people's faces at nearly all the ones I stop in that they're checked out. I can't really blame them for being indifferent- they get yelled at- alot. This is the biggest one I've been to and there is a good amount of staff because of the size. However, during a rush, it's bit of a frustrating mess much like waiting at the post office and this one can get that way. It's the most convenient location so on the few occasions I need a print center, I tend to go to this location.",2
47124,"First of all, it is in East Liberty, Bakery Square--not Shadyside! Give credit where credit is due!! We had an hour to kill so we stopped in on a Friday night about 9:00. Hubby and I were able to sit at the bar, several open tables around. Nice crowd of people, mostly couples. Ordered the stuffed peppers--they were delish! Each of us had two drinks, I had a berry mojito for $9, and although I could not taste the alcohol, it was yummy. Hubby had two Guinesses. Overall, prices are comparable to what you pay in the rest of the city, bartenders were very friendly, I'm sure we will be back. I would not say this would be a destination for us (mostly because of the parking in Bakery Square), but it is a nice \""lay-over.\""",3
13795,"Why on earth do people go to buffets? it feels like cattle lining up and feeding from a trough! most buffet food is bland and mostly over priced anyways. Do people really get their moneys worth? Anyways, my review is for Breakfast The only pro to this buffet was it was free with booking the hotel. The eggs were so runny and cold yuck! every item was pretty bland, bacon was paper thin, every section just had the same selection of things. We would have rather paid our own money and have a nice breakfast somewhere else. I am not a buffet person and probably wont go back to one anytime soon. The bill would have been $45 dollars for fricken breakfast. Id like to know what idiots paying to go to these expensive Vegas buffets thinks paying over $25 for runny eggs is good value?",0
20450,"Went here for dinner Saturday night. Very nice place. We were greeted at the door, shown to our table. Within seconds we had salsa and chips. our server was great. Brought our drinks quickly. the salsa was a little to hot and spicy for me, the chips were fresh. We ordered bean dip which was very good. I liked the touch of the red onion. It was a small amount and not overwhelming. I ordered the charbroiled chicken. BF had the sweet potato enchilada. Both meals were excellent. We will be dining here again. Really enjoyed our meal.",3
20,"The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. The waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though. 1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\"" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL! Sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax. If you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.",1
8722,"We walked into this place to see not 1 but 2 hostesses just walking away from the hostess stand. It was several minutes before we were acknowledged despite the appearance of them being adequately staffed considering they weren't particularly busy. The chips and salsa arrived immediately -- salsa was good but chips were the greasy, stuck together variety. When I asked the waitress for recommendations (the menu is quite extensive) she replied, \""I don't really like mexican food but...\"". Against my better judgement I ordered the arroz con pollo per her recommendation. I ate some of it, it was \""fine\"", but I left about half on my plate and I NEVER leave food on my plate. It was also accompanied by steamed cabbage & other veggies which I found odd and have never experienced in a mexican restaurant before. I'm glad I tried it .. but am glad I didn't have to go out of my way to get there & I won't be going back",1
662,"First time I've been here in five years and it didn't disappoint! There wasn't a lot of traffic on a Saturday which I liked... but based on the food it should have been packed! The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good! The rest dishes were savory and well prepared (had the Kung Pao chicken and crispy orange beef). You can get white or brown rice. The crispy beef was still crispy and the orange sauce had a little bit of a kick to it... just the way I like it. The service was nothing to write home about, but decent nonetheless. You know its a good Chinese place when all the staff talks with a think accent :-)",3
44974,I was forced to have hbo and showtime and nfl ticket when I had this installed. I said I didn't want any of these I was forced to have them for 3 months. The installer said to make sure and cancel by the date because they will charge you. I did call and TRIED to cancel but they could only cancel showtime and hbo. Nfl ticket they couldn't cancel and I would have to wait until I got the bill and call then and cancel. Guess what you POS when I call again it will be to cancel the whole thing. I am tired of being screwed. Talked to my kids and they are canceling as well. So I hope you are happy losing 4 accounts.,0
5584,"I've been going to Town Center Dental for 6 years now. Dr. Devore is one of the best dentists I've had in Vegas. When I first moved here in '93 I bounced around dentists because I couldn't find one. I found one for a few years, but then he retired. 6 yrs ago a colleague at work recommended Dr. Devore. I tried him out and my family has been seeing him ever since. He is a really nice guy who really cares about his patients. I've recommended him to several people and they all love him. A+++ in my book.",4
10211,"Ah Vegas! It's like Disneyland for adults. The Wynn hotel is the most recent addition to this crazy place. Fortunately it's beautiful and elegant...just like the Bellagio except in primary colors...although i still like the atmopshere of Bellagio a little better--maybe it's those fountains. Nevertheless, Wynn Las Vegas is worth checking out....didn't get a chance to stay here, but had a drink in the lounge and it was *very* nice! The guys in the bright blue suits that stand at the front door are cool because they wear those earphones that make them seem like CIA-bellhops",4
15523,"As a long standing patron of the Camelview, it plays the best movies in an otherwise very homogenous film city. Camelview usually has four or five foreign/art house/independent selections, and there's always at least one or two must-sees at any one given time. The five stars is a relative rating. It speaks to the disappointment I feel about there not being enough selection for film goers and movie buffs. Most of the Harkins theaters are clones of themselves, and are generally watery when it comes to quality movie selections. Harkins Valley Art and AMC Shea have some selections worthy of $9 admission;sadly, most others do not. In a fantasy world, AMC Arizona Center would get some decent movies in and start to attract the clientele that would be needed to infuse the type of business that Phoenix is looking to attract there. Hopefully, someone with a little bit of flair and common sense could realize that putting in some art house/indie/foreign selections would draw a crowd, and make some money in downtown Phoenix.",4
28357,Solid breakfast joint off the Strip. French toast is the best thing we tried. But the breakfast burrito is good too. The service is outstanding and they do a good job in keeping the place clean. Other places had a wait of about 30min but this place had us wait a good 20. Plenty of strip mall parking.,2
321,"Almond torte cake is way too overhyped. I ordered one after seeing an article on Huffington Post so with a description like that who wouldn't want to try it!? It's a diabetics worst nightmare, sugar overload. The filling in the middle had a bland taste, nothing special about it. Maybe it's because I ordered the cake and had it shipped to MD that it tasted bad. People raving about this cake should try middle eastern or Greek bakeries! I gave a two because they have great customer service when emailing back.",1
7263,"I have been to many Harbor Freight stores here in the \""valley\"". Most, the staff have been very helpful and only 5 or 6 people in line at the most. Great deals on merchandise for those that are patient ; ) This location at 35th Ave and Bethany Home is the worst. On some Fridays at about 2pm, the management and day staff goes home early leaving the store short staffed with only 2 clerks. One has a bad attitude. The \""head cashier\"" who looks like she's a local tweaker allowed a line to build up of literally 20 customers and refused to open a register herself. The only cashier that was open was helping a customer for about 15 minutes with check problems and was dialing away numbers to the Camarillo, CA office to get approval. It took her 15 minutes to reach someone in accounting while the 20 of us stood in a long line waiting. Some of us asked the head cashier to open up a register and ring us up. She refused and blamed the company for short staffing her. Bad attitude. Told us this is just the was it is on Fridays when the staff runs out from day shift. Finally at 3pm a manager walks in the store and asks whats going on. Some of us customers complained and this cashier finally hops on a register so she doesn't get reamed by the manager. I will not be back to this store location. I will stick with the Glendale and Tempe locations.",0
49072,"I was recently a first time home buyer. A friend of mine recommended that I get in touch with Chris Morrison, who had helped her buy her first house and she was happy to share her great experience with me. When I met Chris, I was greeted with a warm and honest smile. I immediately felt comfortable and that I was in good hands. He showed me a couple of homes and I became well aware that he knew a great deal of the ins and outs of the business. Within days he found me a house that I loved and I couldn't be any happier with the area and my first home! I will be referring everyone to him from here on out.",4
210,"Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!",1
25505,"Big portions. Low prices. Low quality. Basically, quantity over quality. The restaurant offers buffet or takeout. The buffet is relatively cheap, and the cheapness is reflected in the quality of the food. Likewise for the takeout, they give you huge portions for a low price at the expense of quality. I recommend the takeout if you're looking for a quick and cheap eat, but I would keep my expectations low. I wouldn't recommend the buffet.",2
31200,"People who wine and dine at Mcdonald's get a bad rap. Why? Because people who don't dine at Mcdonald's aren't living and are therefore jealous. The truth is only about 20 percent of the population can full unlock the euphoria tunneled away in every bite. We are higher spirits of a different breed than the everyday jealous Mcdonald hater. \""Why you hatin\"" was perhaps invented to suit the likes of these people. For me and my intricate complex neurology, I realize what Mcdonald is was and will always be. That is perfection. It's only because we share this trait in common that we understand eachother.

17163,"Notes: 1 visit, dinner Overall: Salty. (Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat.) Free bread - Best part of the meal! Soooo good. It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it. I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash. Baby back ribs - Came with virtually no sauce. Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish. The fries that came with it were soft and mushy. Ewww. Ceasar salad - Salty. The croutons and the chicken were good, but a salty salad is still a salty salad. Another reminder to always order dressing on the side at restaurants. Coconut shrimp - Don't know if all coconut shrimp is like this, but I didn't like the coconut shreds. They were too tough and didn't add any flavor. Shrimp on the Barbie - Only decent dish that night, and I only say that because it wasn't too salty.",0

47452,Hot Shot Vegas definitely took care of our bachelorette party while we were in Vegas. Jason was very easy to reach and always available. Hot Shot Vegas was extremely accommodating to all of our needs. They were also able to help us out getting into clubs based on our budget. I definitely recommend them for whatever size party you have. Pricing was very reasonable and it beat standing in a taxi line any day of the week! =) Thanks again Jason!! You made our trip so much smoother... I will definitely be giving you a call on our next trip out!!,4

When I go to the Ross in Chandler...or any other Ross for that matter, the shelves are stocked and there's no empty space. This Ross is slim pickins. Many of the shelves are bare and really dusty.

5769,"Only golf in SW... Always in pretty good condition. So many people think it would be narrow because its residential course, but its not- its pretty wide open.

(check previous review on Cassellas) They used to have the best cookies here but today's was a bit overcooked. Still good but not as chewy goody as always. The place is too small and was very crowded ( no place to sit for me today) and the service tends to not be very good.While they are fast I don't find the staff very friendly. It is also on the high end expensive for just a sandwich. I go every now and again when in the neighborhood because I love good sandwiches. I would say better than average but nothing to write home about. Also, a tip- go on off lunch hours.",2

33561,"Not too impressed with this place. Their selection is underwhelming, their prices are above average and the store is cramped and congested. The employees were helpful and friendly, but couldn't help me because they didn't have what I needed in store. Because I am often around this area, I have stopped by on numerous occasions for a product or two. One time I purchased a tent that did not contain poles and another time I bought an air pump that broke upon first using it. I had no problems returning the items, but will forever be skeptical of Big 5 products. Save yourself the time and shop at Dick's or Bass Pro Shops for a better selection, better quality and an overall better experience.",1
41980,"Groomers? More like BUTCHERS! Where did you learn to groom dogs? Or have you??? Obviously there are people there that don't know what they are doing. I had a HORRIBLE experience, called and voiced my concern to both the grooming person in charge and the Petsmart closing manager (who was very nice and made me feel like she was, at least, concerned) but two days later and I've not heard one word from anyone with authority. I made my appt for Saturday morning but got a call from the bather saying that she just had them down for baths and did we want cuts? Ah, yeah...when I made the appointment I told the girl I wanted a full grooming appt, including nails and teeth. Because of the mistake the appointment person made all the appointments were booked so all they had was Saturday night at 6pm. I was bummed and didn't like the idea of being the last appt....didn't want them to want to rush out on a Saturday night but we said okay, they are professionals after-all. Or they are supposed to be anyway. We took our two Bichon's in for a full haircut, nails and teeth too. These dogs were past due for their haircuts, for sure, but before they went in I went through their tails and ears and cut out any big knots because I did NOT want them tugging on the dogs. Their bodies did not have any matting in any spots. We instructed them to cut their nails because we didn't want to cut the dark nails ourselves so \""we'll leave it to the professionals.\"" That's what I told them when I made the appt, what a huge joke that turned out to be! My husband brought the dogs in the house after the appt and my beautiful Bichons looked nothing at ALL like Bichon's! My husband told me that he ordered \""puppy cuts.\"" Ok, that is not their fault, it's not what I wanted but that was not their fault. But that isn't the problem. The problem is they made one of my dogs look like some kind of mutant pit bull with bat ears! My husband said they told him \""we couldn't save Buddy!\"" Huh? The dogs both went in with the same condition of fur. I think they just wanted to be done so they shaved his ears so they could get out of there! Then I looked at their paws and they did cut their nails, EXCEPT FOR THE DARK ONES! They left those long! They charged me $21 per dog, but didn't do the nails that we really needed done. Also, my husband told me that they cut my dogs ear while they were scalping him! He said that he was shaking badly when they went to pick him up. Who knows how they really treated him when we weren't there? They had to report the cut ear because the cut is so big and deep that there is no way we wouldn't have seen it. They didn't include it on the \""report\"" card though. We also thought it strange that they included unused toothbrushes. Does that mean they didn't brush their teeth either? I wish I could post a picture of this dog. Imagine a big kosher pickle with a peanut at the end and that's what my dog looks like now. Oh, add flappy bat ears. They made him look horrible because they didn't want to take the time. They didn't groom him, they SHAVED him! Petsmart could have called to make this better but they blew it off. They already have our money. They should not let anyone groom dogs that don't know how to groom dogs. IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOGS KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THIS GROOMER!!",0

Late night all you can eat at 3AM in the morning after midnight bowling this place just hits the spot.

29370,"So obviously I \""HAD\"" to try this place since it's all about the deserts and well, it was in the movie! I went in looking for what to try... noticing that the prices were a little above average (that's a given), but there are some specialty deserts that are $700+ and $1k+ INSANE!!! No I didn't spend that kind of money on something that melts. We asked the bar tender what Serendipity is known for and what is a \""must try\"". I guess the one in NY there's always a line out the door for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. So that's what we got, while it was on it's way I saw the bar tender make some really yummy looking drinks apparently it was a Berry Mojito and a Strawberry Cheesecake Mojito! And just because it was Vegas and you can... I said \""I'll take one of each to-go as well\"". My thoughts, the Frozen Hot Choc was average, nothing I would stand in line for hours for. It's like a chocolate shake basically that's rich and tastes like it has frozen micro ice in it... the flavor is just that \""hot chocolate\""..... The mojito however.. OMG, yum! I'm not one to like greenery in my alcohol, but these were exceptional. The Cheesecake one is good if you like syrupy and sweet. My personal favorite was the Berry Mojito. I'd give this place another try for some of the actual food next time I'm there.",2

Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates). Some of the best dishes they have aren't sushi at all. The Tuna Salad is bomb.com. Tuna Sashimi on a bed of greens and an awesome sweet/spicy dressing. I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue. A couple tips, Fashion Show Mall employees receive a discount (I think 10% off total not including alcohol) and if you check in on Foursquare and tell your server, you get a free order of edamame or a bowl of miso soup. I also like that the entire staff is aware of their Foursquare specials and don't act jerky when you ask for free things.",3

I have never been to this location for dinner but had a kick butt good dinner at a Houston location a couple years ago so the lunch expectations were high. The service was quite good but the food was just good which is not good enough at these prices. And yes, you are allowed to say \""these prices\"" even at lunch at a place like CG. HITS - Wedge salad. Very yummy blue cheese dressing, quality bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato and as big as your head. The hot, fresh bread and cold butter. AVERAGE - Clam chowder. It had good flavor and a respectable amount of clams but way too many potatoes and was luke warm. MISSES - Chefs burger. Ordered medium rare, served medium well and had barely any flavor to it.

23221,"Piccolo Forno is good. The restaurant sits on the first floor of a handsome old building and the dining room is well-appointed and complimentary to exterior. I received excellent service during my Tuesday evening dinner. I also give Piccolo Forno a few extra points for being a BYOB (just be sure to plan ahead). Piccolo Forno has a great menu, and I would like to try a few more of their dishes (the rabbit, in particular). I ate a lot at Piccolo Forno: bruschette for the first course, linguine with mussels and shrimp for the main, ice cream for dessert, and coffee. I appreciated the fresh pasta, the sauce was tasty, and mussels tender and flavorful. The bruschette was a poor choice on my part -- the out of season tomatoes were watery and bitter, which, when simply seated atop toast, makes for a bland dish. I enjoyed the dessert (Dream Bomba I believe it was called), but a few fresh, housemade dessert options would perfectly compliment a fresh pasta dinner. All in all a solid restaurant that I would be comfortable recommending to friends.",2
35292,"A+++++++++++! Oh my GOODNESS this show is amazing. My boyfriend and I have seen this show twice so far, and both times were equally enthralling. I've loved the Jabbawockeez since ABDC, and I actually cried at the end of the show the first time we saw it. The second time, we were with my boyfriend's family (four 30-something adults) none of which had even heard of the Jabbawockeez- and they LOVED the show. It's entertaining the whole way through, no downtime at all. They do a beautiful job of exciting different emotions through out the show. It's genius, beautiful, and stimulating. They do an excellent job of incorporating the audience as well, so I hope you're not shy! We'll go back again for sure.",4

39043,"Locally-owned coffee shops are the best. Always looking for a new place to try, I heard of Carmel's from a graduate student of mine. Tired of going to LGO, I decided to give this a try today. I ordered a medium chai latte. It was delicious - and I only ever get them at Cartel's! The guy behind the counter added a hint of cinnamon (how did he know that's what I usually put in my coffee?). The extra ingredient did it justice. I went around noon today and the place was semi-packed. Great music (a little bit of Jack Johnson) and I had a great Tuna Salad. The owner (or so I think) was very friendly. I was studying and he came by to thank me for coming in, which was nice. Also, there's a small patio in the back for people who want to read and enjoy the nice weather before it hits 100 degrees. I didn't have my laptop, but on my iPhone I saw that the Wi-Fi was locked. I didn't ask for the password, but I'm sure they would provide it if needed. Parking was scarce. Hard to find, but manageable. Overall, I would definitely come again for the chai latte!!!",3

The service was horrible, the decor obnoxious and the cupcake desserts were, I kid you not, 4/5th icing (seriously gross). Our waitress was no newbie, but maybe she had too many tables, maybe she wasn't too bright or maybe she was just so slow that she couldn't recall the order by the time she got to the computer. She totally forgot our appetizer and I appreciate the fact that she owned up to it twenty minutes later. By the time our food finally arrived, the pasta was cold, but we were so hungry we didn't send it back. Stick to the carry out desserts.",1

8405,"My grandparents came into town from Florida and wanted to go to dinner. Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere, I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona, the answer has always been The Salt Cellar. I want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar. We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet, and our server was amazing. In regards to the food, my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell, which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately, this is where things take a different direction. Crab legs were great, but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy. My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp. He liked the shrimp, but said the steak was not good, and he usually likes, and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather's fish was overcooked, and my grandmother's fried shrimp was soggy. We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time, but had sat out for quite awhile. Let me just say, money is not the issue here. Our bill was 317 dollars after tip, for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food, service and atmosphere I would pay double that. I do realize this is a seafood restaurant, however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing. I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband, \""Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!\"" However, I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant, I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just, eh. Everyone left saying \""It was ok, but not great.\"" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected. I did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was, not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1.",0
5523,"Expecting a professional establishment? Expecting good customer service? Expecting to be greeted as you come in the door? Expecting to be helped in a decent time frame? Well, don't go here, ever. I've been to this place twice and both times were a bad experience. When you walk in the door, you're not sure where to go because the place is so sloppily put together. So naturally you stand, and you wait, expecting for someone to come and help you. Not the case here. The employees sit and have casual conversations while they should be helping customers. I stood and waited for almost 30 minutes both times.. The first time I was coming to buy cleaning solution, the second time, I was coming to get a piercing tightened. Its not like I was going to get some huge tattoo or something, my visits shouldn't have lasted for more that 10 minutes each, yet I was forced to wait and wait, to the point that on my second visit I gave them a piece of my mind and went elsewhere.

You get a bad tip. We ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude. There are much better options out there. I will not be back.",0

Which i think is how diners should be except it's really much louder than you would expect. The waitresses are nice and seem to know everyone which is always good to find. The few things I have ordered to eat have all been pretty bland and not very good. The Blueberry pancakes seem to have real blueberries but they are very tough and \""chewy\"" not sure how that actually happens. Usually blueberries in pancakes are the opposite. The pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland. I can't really recommend them. I have also had an omelet before and it was good nothing to write home about. So if you stop in I would stay away from the pancakes.",1
13757,"Thanks to my uncle who is a Vegas VIP of sorts, he treated us to dinner at the $50 holiday buffet. His status allowed us to bypass to the front of the line. Entering close to 10PM, we were told in line that dinner service would 10:20PM, however we word be able to stay until 11PM. The food was decent, much better then the Paris buffet that we tried in a past year. I enjoyed the wide variety of foods that they offered. The crab legs seemed popular but I chose not to try it. I did not care for their Kobe beef (most certainly false advertising) as it was tough and chewy. I would also pass on the ham which was dry and salty. However, the assortment of Asian inspired and Italian pasta dishes were savory, with the right amount of oily and creaminess respectively. I also enjoyed their peppermint cheesecake for dessert but was sad they already turned off their ice cream maker at that time. All in all, I was able to enjoy two of the three plates I had and that is enough to give this buffet a thumbs up.",2

If that's medium well, I'd hate to see well... Maybe if I buy enough well done patties, and put them into a trash compactor, they'll turn into man-made diamonds! Fries were limp and definitely the cheap shoestring kind (suggestion - put them in a separate breathable bag for to-go orders, so that their own humidity doesn't make them into a soggy mess) Pricey for this quality of food, and they probably justify it because they have a juicer behind the counter, making them a \""healthy\"" place that can charge a premium.

Chicken wings-really good ( not really Asian or Chinese but I really like crispy wings) Shrimp shumai really good Greens-i think they were some sort of asian broccoli. My favorite things were the tea, sesame ball with sweet filling and shumai. Con's,: way too busy and crowded but there's nothing you can do about that. That's just the way dim sum is I don't like getting passed up by anyone with the carts.

Con: The store is dirty. The employees can be nasty. They are often out of staple items like milk and bread and soft drinks. They have few checkers, they try to steer you to self-checkout machines that don't work, you will stand there waiting forever for someone to come and fix the self-checkout machine. They are obsessed with stopping you on the way out of the store and checking your receipt, a practice which is of questionable legality. And the self-checkout machines are obsessed with calling you a thief (\""Unauthorized item in the bagging area!

36376,"Thank you Spirit Airlines for being the airline that lacks compassion. My grandmother passed away before I could use my airline ticket that I purchased to say my goodbyes. In an attempt to modify my ticket to fly out for the funeral, I encountered rude and unhelpful operators. Spirit Airlines policy is to charge the consumer a $125 fee to cancel a reservation and receive zero credit from the original plane ticket purchased. The other option is to pay $125 to modify the ticket to another date, which is slightly reasonable. What was not reasonable was telling a mourning grandchild that they must immediately pick a date to modify their trip for a funeral. When I was disappointed to hear that they had no grievance policy, I informed them that I would need to call back since I was unsure of the funeral dates. The operator's response was \""Just to let you know Ms. Perez, when you call back our policies will not change.\"" I work in a profession that allows our employees to do what is in the customer's best interest.

49152,"I am so glad I capped off 3 days in a row and 3 shows with Olivia! She is my father's celebrity crush and when we found out she was debuting her show the last night he was in town, I got tickets during the pre-sale. We got in line about 30 minutes before the show, which starts at 7:30 PM. This is the same showroom that features Donny & Marie and George Wallace. While waiting in line, I realized I was perhaps 3 decades younger than everyone else, but what the heck! We had balcony seats at a table. We sat with a couple from Ontario, Canada. Olivia was very conversational with the audience and had a band complete with a percussionist, bassist, drummer, and back-up vocalists, one of which played a variety of instruments including the fabulous flute, saxophone, and even harmonica. The female back-up vocalist also helped Olivia with the majority of her on-stage costume changes, which was changing jackets primarily. She only did one costume change at the end of the show before a 2-song finale, wearing head-to-toe gold sequins. She sang songs from all aspects of her career, pre-Grease and post-Grease. She is an Aussie who moved to England at 18 and sang in lounges. She sang songs she was inspired by, like \""Cry Me a River\"" by Julie London (in V for Vendetta for my generation). Olivia sang from Xanadu, from her country hits in her early days, songs from her 90s album Gaia, and of course...PHYSICAL! The most excitement for the crowd came from her 4 minute montage of her life early in the show, with pictures hinting at the order of her career, and the nod to Grease. She started with a tease of \""Look at me I'm Sandra Dee\"" and then broke into songs from Grease with her back-up singers: You're the One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, and We Go Together. The crowd went wild! Sure, there were songs throughout the show I did not know, but I did not grow up with ONJ so I was just thrilled to see my dad so happy. Cool show no matter what generation you belong to, I'd say!",3

After waiting for 40 minutes to get our dishes, I find myself wondering where my money went? I ordered a roast rib sandwich and I wished I was at Subways eating a $5 foot long. The meat was dry, the bread was hard, the sauce came straight out of a plastic BBQ bottle. Fries were old, the tea was watered down Lipton, only thing decent was the bread..... Seems like the cooks ran out of any type of seasoning in the kitchen. We also ordered their white fish special, which is equally overpriced and void of any sort of taste.

I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes. I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is. Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for \""dates\"" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.

34552,"this review may be a bit underrated as i was only at the mercat to attend an event. so due to this, perhaps didn't experience the full of extent of what the bar has to offer. but that said, the drink selection is pretty decent (although my boyfriend was disappointed that he could only get prosseco and not champange, but i think this is normal for most mid-range bars and probably a request they very infrequently get). however, there was a large number of spirits available and beers on tap or bottled. so no one went thirsty. i noticed that some people had ordered food and it smelled good, but i can't report on the quality as i didn't have any. i have to say that the service though was excellent. there was a large number of people, some very drunk, constantly at the bar ordering more drinks. but the bartenders were polite (although they did look a wee bit harassed, which i dont' blame them for) and did their best to keep up with the demand for drinks. so i did find this place A-OK and i'm sure on a return visit i'll be happy to update my review and perhaps add another star. but in terms of use for a mid-size event, this was a good venue. they booked out the lower bar for us which was a great space and had it's own private bar so no need to travel upstairs. my only real complaint was the spiral staircase between the floors. i mean a few drinks and wearing heels meant that i had great difficulty in not falling on my face when i attempted to go up or downstairs. perhaps they should re-think this design in terms of customer health and safety!",2
35097,"This review is for the Motley Brews Craft Beer Tailgate Festival that was held on 11/14/10 at the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 On The Strip. This was my first beer festival and being that my husband loves trying beers from all over the world, this was right up our alley. The venue should have been pointed out heavily that it was the one on the strip. There is a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 on Paradise, right around the corner, so that was kind of confusing for some people. When we pulled up at 1:30pm, there was a line out the front door and around the corner. We pulled into the Showcase parking and realized that it was $3.00 per car, CASH ONLY!!! and no coins. We had 3 cars behind us, and neither my husband and I had any cash on us (doh!) but the car behind us paid for us (THANK YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE! I will definitely pay-forward this good-deed of the day!) We parked and went inside, only to wait another 15 minutes to get into the venue. The venue itself was good size and it was layed out nicely. There were TVs with the football games on and LOTS of beer tasting. You can taste unlimited amounts of beer. You get a 4 oz. shot glass (bigger than a regular shot glass) that you get to keep and that is what you taste all the beers out of. The food line was pretty long, but we thought the food was damn good. Coconut shrimp, wings, wontons, fresh veggies, cheese, nachos and so much more. Good job on the free food! Everyone was really cool, friendly and helpful. I would definitely head back to the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 for any sort of festival and I hope that Motley Brews puts on another festival!",3
44379,"I/we have eaten at the Chop several times in the past year and any time we sit elsewhere besides sitting at the bar, our service has been horrible. I hate asking the waiter/waitress to refill my water or coffee cup over and over again, especially when the restaurant is charging you $12.00 for a martini. On a positive side, historically the food has always been excellent. Last night after sharing a few appetizers, my wife and I shared a fresh sea bass dinner for $29.50, which was very tasty. However, for $29.50 (which I thought was priced high to begin with) you would think the total size of the serving would be larger then about 4-5 ounces. I believe our days of dinning at the Chop has come to a halt.",1
20821,"I think I'm a little bias because I loved this casino when it was Aladdin, but I just feel like ever since PH has taken over, it hasn't been quite the same. They try to jazz up the interior by putting in deep rich colored carpets and a very Hollywood and/or nightlife-like atmosphere, but for the most part the casino looks the same and all the slots are still old. The rooms I would imagine to be quite nice but PH is always a must visit for me every time I come to Vegas simply because I'm a big fan of the Miracle Mile shops. I love that there are so many stores, normal stores at that, which sell normal people underpriced, on sale and great size selection items. I love that they kept the thunderstorms in the shops. Mostly though, I love the random strips of casino through the shopping so when you're tired, you can take a seat, lose some money, and keep going! The casino is arranged in an ok fashion, they somehow have a Pink's hot dogs stand outside although I'm not sure how authentic it really is ... The buffet is the same and I still like it, but I don't think it has *as* much variety as before. Their shows are somewhat lackluster as compared to other casinos. I don't know that I would necessarily stay here again, but if there was some killer deal it's definitely not a BAD hotel to be at.",2
20119,"This is for the location inside of the Mirage. I havent been on Yelp in a few to write reviews, so this review is from mid-Sept. The main reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service or lack of decent service inside the Mirage. As always, CPK is good and I havent had a bad pizza yet. On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food. The server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it. When checking the final bill which was lower, the server actually added the pasta dish and charged me but had it removed.",1
27001,"The place is new but not nice. It's middle of the road decor. The walls are thin so you can hear every word from your neighbors and then you are right next to the airport. It's a mile from the strip too - not walkable unless you don't plan to walk much once you get to the strip. Consider renting a car to get back and forth to the strip. Staff was not that friendly either. And, DON'T do the timeshare presentation. It took more than 3 hours and we kept saying \""No\"" which wasn't taken seriously. They kept offering another lower option...did you know the can get down to $695 for a trial year. Way different from the $32k that it started from. I wish I had paid for a hotel, the free stay wasn't worth the headache.",0
46905,"Decided to give this place a try....First, let me say the bartenders could use a bit more personality. With that said, we ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and was told it was big enough for 2. Well, yes it was, but was no larger than a large Subway. the sauce was acidy and very spicy. Not hot spicy, but spicy. SALTY as well. The salad that came with it would have been much better with just a simple oil and vinegar dressing with pepper and salt. The dressing was piled on it, making the lettuce soggy. I think it was comprised of some sort of soured cream and lemon mixture. and SALT once again. We each had one glass of wine and the bill was a staggering 46.00 with tip. I could have gone to Russo's for a much better sandwich, for a lot less. Nope, won't be going back. Too many other better places here in Vegas, on and off strip.",0
37356,"Unbelievably amazing. The food was phenomenal. Had a nice table outside which set the ambiance. We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer - fabulous, we should have ordered two for the three of us. The curry dish was amazing. I can't stress how tasty it was! We asked for it spicy and it def had a kick. There was a lot too so that I was able to really indulge. The quinoa burger was ok. We also ordered a butternut squash pizza. This had a unique flavor but we really liked it. I found the spiced apple drink to be too spiced for me but many yelpers really love it. I can't wait to eat here again.",4
16496,"Initially I was going to stay at MGM but they were overbooked and gave my reservation away to another guest. I was exited when they upgraded me to The Signature however they made everyone who was upgraded wait about an hour before we were able to check in to our rooms. The rooms were about a mile away from the casinos and the front desk were assholes from begininning to end. I stayed at the PH suite where the room were no bigger than Bellagio's. Upon my departure, I mention the wait and told them it was the worst experience ever. The dumbfuck front desk was not apologetic and ignored me until I left. What a piece of shit hotel!!! I would never stay here. My recommendation is The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. The regular rooms there is a hundred times better than the PH suite at The Exclusive.",0
26485,"I have visited La Unica many times and the experience has always been consistent... excellent food and excellent service. I am hooked on the Tacos La Unica. Two or three of these and I am happy! I have also dined on many of the specials mainly during the lunch hour and they have all been excellent. The chips and salsa are free. The food prices are very reasonable for the quality. We have never had a bad experience. The staff is always prompt and polite. The manager always makes an effort to stop by and say hello to us and make sure we are being taken care of and that the food is good. My family loves to go to La Unica and asks all the time to go. Now that La Unica is on my mind, maybe I'll be the one asking to go tonight! I would give five stars if they had cervesas or margaritas, but consider this a 4.5.",3
26588,"I wish I could say more good things about this place but I was very disappointed. Okay, the girls are pretty and there is a lot of TV's. That's it. The food is overpriced and not very good. Same for the drinks. Afterwards, my friends and I wished I went somewhere else. Definitely over rated. Hooter's would of been a better idea, lol. The one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that I befriended that day. He was a childhood friend of one of my buddies. He ended up picking up the check which was over $200. Thanks Dave.",1
42199,"How in the world does this place not have at least 4 stars. I have yet to find a better tasting burger in the valley. Yes it's a little expensive $25 for two people, but it's great to go every once in a while. Every order is to-go. They give you a drink cup full of frys and drastically overflow your cup so that the whole bottom of the bag is basically frys. A little greasy, buy delicious if you like a little grease in your food. In-N-Out is walking distance from my house, but when I have a burger craving I always go to five guys. Get Cajun seasoning on the frys Toppings are free Soooo many frys! :D Mmmm.. Go get a burger already!",4
37806,"Must have been an off night cause this place was WICKED HORRIBLE!! I cannot beleive they have the balls to charge 35 dollars to eat here. Here are my problems with this place. 1-Service - If you're going to charge 35 dollars a person, at least have a full time server. I had to pour my own water which is kept on the table along with the glasses. Also what the hell is up with keeping the wine bottle on the table with the glasses it takes up way too much space. If we didn't order it, clear it off the table (which is the size of a full sized pillow). 2- Food- EVERYTHING WAS WAY TOO SALTY. Food stayed out way to long sometimes, so its not as fresh as it should be. Also way to slow on replenshing food. Plus the variety was poor too, not much to choose from. Bone Marrow bones were disgusting and not much of a salad selection. Also needs to redirest A/C to not blow directly on table, makes hot food cold. 3- Dessert- I didn't really have desert but my g/f did. She likes to take 1 of each desert and try to see whats the best and she couldn't find one thing. Also we over heard the couple sitting next to us they said the dessert was not good. Overall this was the worst outing I have ever HAD...... PERIOD. I have never been so annoyed after eating at a buffet, you can usually find at least one thing that is good but not here. (I actually had to throw up afterwards). I will not be coming here again.",0
24048,"Create has been on our \""wanna try it\"" list for a while now. We heard great things and knew it was locally owned and a family business. Since we live in Mountain's Edge and don't work or shop up in this area, we made the journey for my Husband's birthday lunch. When you arrive, grab a clip board and pick what you want using a dry erase marker. I had a pretty typical burger. Pepper Jack cheese, Kaiser roll, L, T, O, their \""special sauce\"" paired with sweet potato fries. Husband had a very similar burger with grilled onions and onion rings. Pricing was very reasonable and on top of that we were using our Entertainment Book BOGO coupon. Right off the bat I can say that while it was OK, we won't be making a special drive up to eat here again. It was just OK. Nothing super spectacular, just kind of average. The bun was not my favorite, too chewy. The ingredients fresh were but the burger lacked flavor and juiciness. The two essential elements to a winning burger joint, such a shame cause I had such high hopes and I hate to see a locally owned business miss the target. Sweet Potato fries were VERY good! They could give other burger places a sweet potato fry training! My husband also had a scoop of s'mores custard and it was very good! I might come back to try more custard offerings when and if we are in the area, but I would pass on burgers.",1
47445,"I was searching for a place to go for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and had no luck finding a decent restaurant. I stumbled upon The Gladly and saw they had pretty much the most extensive whiskey list I've ever seen at a restaurant, not to mention the great reviews. My boyfriend and I love whiskey so I made a reservation on the spot. First impressions ranging from the decor to the mood lighting to the staff was exceptional. Our table was about 10 minutes past due but we didn't mind as we were hanging out at the bar enjoying ourselves and relaxing. The boyfriend had the Gladly Manhattan and it was probably one of the best Manhattan's we've ever had. Delish! They were running a Restaurant Week special which included an appetizer, entree and dessert for $30. This was a phenomenal deal as one entree would cost you about $30 alone. Done! I ordered the Caesar salad, Chimichurri Chicken (which was perfectly cooked and so tender), and the White Chocolate Blondie for dessert. Everyone at our table ordered something different and they all had nothing but great things to say about their food. We had a little family style dinner going on as we all wanted to try what the other had. Definitely not disappointed by any of the dishes, including the special \""Pickled Pork Temple\"" dish that our friend ordered at the behest of our waiter who was so lively and friendly! This restaurant was a fantastic choice for a birthday dinner and we will absolutely be back for more! Thank you The Gladly for providing such a great atmosphere; the food, drinks and service was incredible!",4
49755,"Was anxious to try the Edgewater after its renovations and reopening. Went twice -- once with friends for dinner and another time to show my visiting relative the new buildings. The Statehouse is beautiful and the Edgewater is still a wonderful location. Food was OK, not really special. Had the walleye pike. Service was very nice but very inept. Our waitress was covering for the bartender as well and knew nothing about making drinks. She served a glass a prosecco in a large wine glass instead of a champagne flute. at the bar the next night, I asked the same waitress for an Irish Coffee on a very cold night and was served whiskey and lukewarm coffee in a glass; no whipped cream at all, none offered. My wife ordered a Sambuca. It arrived over ice (supposed to be served neat with a couple of coffee beans as a garnish; flamb\u00e9e optional). These things could be fixed with a little training or even by consulting a bartender's guide for one brief second before serving. I sure hope that they invest some time and money into staff training to get the service level to rise to the level of the setting.",1
10557,"I'm not a gynecologist, but I'll have a look. I don't know who that blonde wearing the blue thong was or where her daddy issues came from, but I finally figured out how I want to die when I grow up. I want that fucking blonde from last weekend to sit on my God damn pretty Asian face and suffocate me to death. That would be an amaaaazing way to go out. NOM NOM NOM. Eat her ass up like shrimp fried rice. Her butthole smelled like Heaven. I'm not gonna lie. I like the Rhino much better than this place. I just feel like the set up and the slam pieces at the Rhino are of a much better caliber. A good portion of the slams at Sapphire look like Krusty the Klown. They're of a lesser quality, BUT every once in a while you will meet an incredible slam piece loaded with daddy issues and eating disorders (SUCH a turn on). So it's kind of like do I want a dance from Emmanuelle Chriqui at the Rhino or do I want a dance from Amy Whinehouse at Sapphire? Hmmm... Anyways, if you're at any of these strip clubs then I suggest getting bottle service. It's obv the way to go. You're not walking around aimlessly and accidentally touching other dudes' boners. Instead, you're at a table with your boys passing slams around from lap to lap like you guys used to pass around the \""hot potato\"" back in first grade.

34741,"This place is great. The rates are pretty reasonable, the rooms are nice and clean, the restaurants are good and the gambling is fantastic. I stayed here last year from July 13th through July 16th and I really enjoyed my stay. I also won a good amount of money, so that was nice, too. The only issue I had with the place was the check-in time. I waited in line to check in for around a half hour or 45 minutes. I usually don't mind waiting, but they should have had more staff on hand. That said, my luggage WAS delivered to my room so that was nice not having to lug that big suitcase around. Anyway, the place is great and is within walking distance of so many great places. I really recommend staying here!",3
23193,"In case you're wondering, you need a passport to get into the FBR Open to prove your citizenship. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recently determined that tanned, plastic looking people have in fact taken over the TPC in Scottsdale on an annual basis only to defect to their ultra-lounge havens to hibernate until the following year. I'm really not sure what to think of this. They speak English (but very faux surferish) and look American, but act completely juvenile, foolish and quite frankly, foreign. Additionally, while waiting for the shuttle bus at Barcelona - ground zero for these immigrants, you can overhear the most ridiculous conversation. Most of these immigrants started drinking at the makeshift bar in the Barcelona parking lot. One woman talked of her plan to sacrifice her bra and panties on the 16th green in her effort to score Super Bowl tickets. Another woman (while in the bus) rated men walking down Hayden as we drove by \""10! You're a 9. You're more like a 7. Ew, you're a 5.\"" The men were not to be outdone. Who needs shuttle buses when you can just walk down Hayden, strip down to your bare, over-tanned chest while ladies driving by ask if you need a ride. In a traditional immigrant mating call, women wore the most appropriate golf course attire they could find. On a cloudy 60 degree day many opted for mini skirts, tank tops, tacky fake Chanels, high heels and gawdy jewelry. Men meanwhile chose over-gelled hair dos, flip flops or tube socks, shorts and Ed Hardy tees or golfy looking sweaters that they could spill their double-fisted beers all over. Suffice to say, that was a quick synopsis of some of the crowd at the FBR. Some people actually went to watch golf, enjoy a few $7 brews on a glorious winter afternoon in Scottsdale and watch the rowdiest, drunkest spectators in all of golf boo, jeer and hiss at the 16th hole. Greenskeeper tix and Corporate Village tix are bonus if you can land them. This event hasn't become a national attendance breaker on the PGA circuit for nothing. FBR Open is to Phoenix as Mardi Gras is to New Orleans. Drunken debauchery. This event has come to embody Phoenix for better or worse and as a locally grown event, from its fledgling days at the Phoenix Country Club, that says a lot. I have a good time every time I go -- plastic Scottsdale immigrants or not. Five stars.",4
15939,"The problem with North Tempe is it's dominated by large chain restaurants and Starbucks. Steve's Espresso breaks the mold and is the boutique coffee shop and lounge I've been looking for. They have the best coffee, tea, and fresh made pastries in all of Tempe. It's in an unassuming location and you've probably driven passed it a thousand times and didn't even know it was there. Make a point to stop by and I promise you wont be disappointed. My favorite is a Mocha with Almond Milk, no whip, and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. So good.",4
35330,"If the caf\u00e9 out of Eastenders were real, I'm pretty sure this is what it would be like. I've never seen somewhere that better sums up the definition of \""good old greasy-spoon caf\u00e9\"" as well as Brambles. It's only just opened, and I assumed it would be yet another of these sandwich/wrap/panini type places that Edinburgh is crawling with, but I was very wrong. Although Brambles do offer things like baked potatoes and paninis, their specialty is anything fried served with chips and buttered bread. And I mean literally everything - from good old chicken nuggets, chips and beans to remind you of school dinner days, to friend haggis and chips and mushy peas. They did have some slightly healthier options on the menu, like lasagne (served with chips, of course!) but it's not really the kind of place you go to eat healthy food. The lace curtains, neon sign in the window and plastic tables should be the most off-putting thing you've ever seen, but it works in that sort of way that it's so bad it's good. It's kitsch, a bit tacky and dated, despite only being open a few weeks, but it does exactly what it says on the tin and serves good honest junk food at really reasonable prices.",2

3282,"Just want to say off the bat that in no way am I affiliated with Shane Co or getting kickbacks from them. Just writing an honest review on my experience there recently. 1) Overall/ Intro 2) Sales reps 3) Selection process 4) Price negotiation 5) Conclusion 1) The staff was very comforting and professional. I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked. It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include: -lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen -60 day refund or exchange after purchase -6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score. 2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf. 3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later. 4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! 5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE.",4
35603,"Sandra's customer service to me was outstanding on the selling of the furniture!!! And Javier and his workers were outstanding in the delivery of the furniture!!! First Sandra, she answered all of my many questions. Then I had her talk and answer my wife's (who was in Pa.) questions over the phone. Yes, the price was higher than I wanted to pay for patio furniture, but with the Arizona weather I didn't want to be buying furniture every two or three years. They are so confident about their products that all their furniture is displayed outside to show their customers how well it keeps in the Arizona weather. So after an hour or so of discussion and looking at all the selections, I decided on the furniture. But since my stairwells in my house are narrow, Sandra suggested I measure the width before I finalize the purchase. Returning later that day with the measurements, I met Javier. Javier said if my measurements are correct, the couch and chair will not fit through the stairwells (the furniture is for our bedroom balcony which is on the fourth level of our home). To make sure of the measurements, Javier and I jumped in his car and went to my place so he could be sure that my numbers were correct. Unfortunately, my measurements were correct. So the deal is off????? Wrong!! Javier comes up with the idea of renting a crane to place the frame of the couch and the chair on the roof of my building. Then he and his workers would lower the furniture down from the roof to the balcony. After imagining all the things that could wrong, I agreed to the plan. Well it worked to perfection!!!!!! No incidents or damage to property or bodies. The furniture looks absolutely fantastic on our balcony!!!!! Sandra and Javier were excellent in handling everything that was needed to satisfy my purchase and delivery. You can't ask for better Unique Patio Creations. Thanks Guys!!!!!",4

I've been to the Keg in Old Montreal many times, which is always a great experience. Friendly staff and good food. Here at Place Ville-Marie... it was a different story. The staff was plentiful, young, attractive and bored. They all stood around chatting and flirting with one another instead of attending to customers. The worst part were the hosts/hostesses. They were plain rude and upset that we were carrying large bags. They wanted us to check them. Ridiculous - there was lots of space at the tables, and the restaurant was half empty. We received a lot of attitude. I will never be back at this location! When in Montreal, go to the one located at the Old Port instead. So much better.",0

39336,"2nd time I've tried this place in 2 years. I regret that decision. Came here last year and picked up an order for my wife and 2 girls, everything was wrong and we were missing a whole sandwich. My fault for assuming they could give me everything I paid for without me double checking. Fast fwd to this year and the girls really wanted a donut. Once again, staff was less than courteous, poor help with a confusing menu that we are unfamiliar with. My wife ordered chicken salad with her bland latte. 10 mins later they let us know they didn't have chicken salad, so they offered a fried chicken sandwich. Instead my wife asked for the turkey that I had ordered. Hers came on a croissant, mine was on a French roll. The picture shows about an inch of turkey piled on the roll, the real sandwiches were seriously 1 slice of turkey. Wow. $22 for 2 coffes, 2 hot chocolates, 2 donuts, and 2 turkey sandwiches.

6566,"So, Jolly Bob's is now closed, and I was in search of something to fill the massive hole it left in my heart (and stomach). Sadly, Jamerica just did not do that. Immediately, I liked the vibe: chill, serve yourself a beverage from the cooler, motherly figure waiting on you. But that was kind of it. The rest was disappointing. I ordered the chicken curry and a Jamaican beef patty to start, and was then told they were out of both. So I switched to a veggie patty and BBQ chicken. My companions ordered Mango Rundown Tofu and Jerk Chicken. The BBQ chicken was good, but nothing particularly amazing. The sauce was spicy and not too sweet. The tofu was pretty good, but really sweet, and between the tofu, stewed veggies, and rice, it was all the kind of the same texture. The jerk chicken was best: spiced well and tender. The sides, rice and beans and stir fried veggies were nothing spectacular, but they rounded out the plate. Overall, it was just kind of underwhelming. Probably won't be rushing back any time soon.",1

The real star of the show is the 8.99 steak special. For nine bucks you get a 10 oz steak, baked potato, salad, green beans, and a beer of your choice. I expected the steak to be a thin, cheap, grisly piece of meat. But it was actually a nice cut that was cooked perfectly. If you don't have a players card the price is 11.99 and it doesn't come with a beer. It's still a good deal at that price. Our server was nice enough to let us use an extra voucher that he had, and that made it even better.",4
883,"Wow, this antique mall seems to go on and on forever. It is huge and has a wonderful selection of collectibles. I am in the market for collectible books and they had so many books, that I could not see them all in this trip. There are a lot of kitchen items, dishes and vintage toys. This is a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon. The prices were reasonable. There was a check in offer and some of the dealers booths have coupons.",3
13525,"Friends of mine wanted to go here to celebrate some birthdays. It was cute - they gave the birthday ladies each a mug with a balloon tied to it, and they could go up to a special place at the bar to get free drinks all night. The free drinks were draught beers and a few basic mixed drinks, I think. It's very kitschy and this is the official birthday place. I ordered a burger, and it was perfectly good. Nothing to write home about, and it's good for groups. We came on a weeknight so I can't say anything about crowdedness. Seems like it's most fun if you're the one celebrating your birthday :) And free drinks all night - you can't complain about that!",2
1697,"This Saks location has to be my personal favorite for their service style. Everyone is friendly, they great you, they often offer you a water bottle, however they let you wander if you tell them your just looking, and check on you sporadically but never smother. Also they have the best makeup counter service of any store in the valley, period. My favorite is the YSL and Dior shared counter. Those ladies and gentleman are the best at telling you about their lines as well as other alternatives. For example on my last visit they showed me their concealer and ran to the Nars counter to show me one with more coverage. Which is what I was looking for. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because shoe sales rack has really dwindled in size over the last year or two. Other than that, this place is fantastic.",3
37285,Good lines. Some of the best anywhere. Sports book owned by Cantor gaming which is separate from the M Resort owners. So they don't share rewards programs. The design is great and seats comfortable. Location is great right next to poker room and the big deli which is open really late maybe 24 hours but double check and they have good food while watching sports. Also the 32 degree bar is attached and you can see games from the bar area while eating and drinking. Strong sports book all around.,3
21476,"UPDATE! They are only open until 8 pm M-Th and till 8:30 on Fridays. We were turned away when we came in at quarter to 8, thinking the were open till 8:30. The websites including this one all say 8:30 pm PT. Big disappointment. We will go to Touch of Thai where they are so happy to see us. Still good food but major bummer.",2
16301,"After a disappointing pulled pork sandwich at another barbecue place - Sassy Sal's in the Northwest- I was still craving the real thing so my girlfriend recommended we go to TC's which has been a favorite of hers for a while. We had a certificate from Restaurant.com which obliged us to eat there and while we were originally hoping for take-out, I'm glad we stayed. First impression - I really liked the decor which had great, vibrant color along with tasteful framed photographs on the wall which made you feel right at home. This is exactly what I want from a barbecue joint -clean, tasteful, casual, and homey. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive throughout. The food was the real deal - plenty of great tasting pulled pork with just a bit of sauce on the bun and great coleslaw to go on top. My girlfriend got a two meat combo with beef ribs, hot links, and two sides which she said was also good. The peach cobbler was great - and I don't even like peaches! I can't wait to try the glazed donut bread pudding. I'm kicking myself that I've lived down the street from TC's for two years and this was only my first time there. They've got a ton of lunch specials for only $4.99 and daily specials. 'll definitely be back soon.",4
17422,Just had Father's Day lunch here. Enjoyed the food but not great service. Our server rarely came over. I was thirsty for more water 90% of the meal. Needed more salsa and had to ask someone else because our server was nowhere to be found. I get it when things are busy you cannot be everywhere but she didn't even acknowledge that we were clearly being neglected. That was my first time so could have been random bad experience.,1
12363,"Stayed at Ziggurat Suite @ NYNY over Thanksgiving. Service: Although the line was long at the check-in, some of the clerks were just looking into the computer screens and not bothering to help ppl check in faster. Unit: EVERYTHING in the unit was very dated: from plumbing to the bed covers. Not even basic toiletries were provided. No tea or coffee pot. Old bulky TV's taking up lots of space. .. Dual Piano bar was hideous with $25 per person entry. Wait is extremely long by the elevators, 10 -15 min during check-out time. Will never stay there again.",0
48093,"Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer.",0
31895,"Wow. And this is not a good wow at all. Did NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos. The waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only \""amazing\"" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. Considering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless. The manager we got to \""work\"" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant. There seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working. I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing. None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. Now, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out. Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no. That's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us. Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job? The waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw. Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one. The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good. The one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard. Final report: More style than substance.",0
29822,"If grandma comes to town and tells you a place reminds HER of Key West, you know it's legit. But I didn't need that sort of confirmation. At first I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything other than the bananas foster french toast (and trust me, someone at your table NEEDS to get this dish - don't worry, the full size order is way more than enough to share). But then, one day, I tried something else - the Local Breeze Omlet... whoa! Scrambled eggs, Proscuitto, Goat Cheese, Asparagus, Tomato, Basil galore. In the mood for lunch? Just go for anything on the menu. Salads, burgers, sandwiches... just point to something and you'll be pleased no matter what. But the best suggestion I can give on this place is go for the weekend brunch. You'll be glad you did. And I feel obligated to share this secret, since I just learned of it this weekend myself... Rocky Point eggs (trust me on this one). Full disclosure: they stop serving breakfast foods around 11am. DO NOT MISS THIS DEADLINE! Also, although good, I would skip the sangria (and don't expect an $8 value out of your $8 mimosa). Be sure to check out the bathroom before you go (go before you go?), it's pretty cool, like the rest of the place. And, 10% discount if you ride your bike on the weekends. Are you heading to Local Breeze yet?",4
2520,"I have nothing to compare this too as I've never eaten Vietnamese food ever. I've also never tried pho. Stopped here for lunch on a whim and it was delicious! The place was packed (good sign) and my husband and I got the sampler thing (pho, egg and spring roll). It was all yummy although we had no idea what to do with all the extra - the sauces and things that came on the side- we needed a tutorial! We will be back!!",4
33854,"This place is a spot we have past for the last couple years and finally decided to give this bar a shot. When walking in there are two entrances, one leads to the bar while the other goes to the sit down restaurant area. The menu has a \""Mardi Gras, New Orleans\"" vibe.. however the food has nothing to do with quality Louisiana cooking other than names. I tried the chicken finger appetizer with the Stupid sauce which is basically blended habaneros and vinegar. The chicken fingers were 6.95 and came with 4 fingers, two pieces of celery and two carrot pieces.. THATS IT!! .. not worth 6.95.... I then tried the fish and chips for dinner and it came with 3 small pieces of fish that were cooked fair, fries that were very generic, and god-awful slaw. These were 7.95 and also not worth it. Wife tried the Mushroom Burger which came with garlic fries .. Burger was good and cooked medium and fries were generic with tons of garlic salt on them. I tried the Jambalaya and it tasted like perfume and was bland. Overall the food was very generic and the portions were skimpy and prices on some thing were not worth it. With that being said the drink prices are fair and not bad. I tried a bloody mary which came in a nice big glass and tasted good for only 2.50. The server did a fine job as she was running tables at restaurant side and also bartending. I would not give this place a 2nd try for food however I would think it was a good spot to grab a quick drink.",1
40262,"My husband and I were doing some shopping and decided to grab a bite to eat. I love tea so we chose English's for our meal. We had two waitresses and both of them were incredibly kind and down to Earth. Not like many places where you're made to feel like you're an inconvenience. We ate exclusively off the happy hour menu and were delighted with the prices. The food was so delicious!! Fresh and full of flavor...not greasy at all. The chips and curry appetizer was amazing! Unfortunately we were too full to even try any desserts. I had the Jasmine tea and it was heavenly! It was the perfect temperature. We couldn't get enough so our waitress kindly brought us a cup to go. Oh, and don't miss out on the Poutine!",4
39893,"This was by far the most amazing birthday evening ever. First off, this place is not for the financial faint of heart. At $150 a plate, it is on the high end of meals I have ever had. So would I do it again? We booked our next evening before we left. The tasting menu was an epic event. Course after course of quality dishes that superseded the previous. Topping things off with the best custard dish that I've ever had. The staff was amazing. Friendly, involved, attentive and just great folks. They even gave my wife a birthday card signed by the entire staff. Talk about attention to detail and really serving the guests. If you like sushi, you will love this place.",4
37866,Unfortunately the food did not meet expectations. I was excited about the individual dishes but the quality was poor overall. Dishes were not seasoned well and tasteless. The bone marrow bones were dried out. The breakfast buffet was odd. Got there at 8:30am and there were more dinner items then actual breakfast items. Could not help but wonder if it was simply leftovers from the night before. I love a good buffet but this was not.,0
14431,"This place was nice at the casino not to many people however, some of the workers were rude. The place after late hours on the strip was not a safe feeling environment and one part of the place where the food places were had nothing but homeless and smelled bad. Not a place I would recommend for someone to stay at. Advice; keep for a last resort.",1
18139,"The hotel over all is pretty good, but my only complaint was that my room had a bit of a strange odor. The hotel is huge with several towers. The casino has everything a gambling enthusiast might want; slots, tables, cards. There are also a few restaurants inside tho they will cost you a pretty penny. The pool is about average size, and I say this because we visited several other hotels while we were there and they seemed to have some bigger ones. But I really did enjoy the swim up bar If you are not too concerned about the view from your balcony, the price of the rooms is not too bad either, but watch out for the odor. In the end, I think this hotel is decent for the price that we paid.",2
13148,"I do not care how low the rates may be I will never stay here again. We recently went on a girls weekend and stayed here. At check in the lady was like a robot. No expressions, no warm welcome, nothing. We went to our rooms that we were told connected and they didn't. We were ultimately given 4 sets of rooms and shuffled back and forth from the east and west towers before our bellman finally got us two rooms that connected. He was the only helpful employee our entire stay at the Luxor. Multiple times the valet only opened the driver's door and walked away. When we called to ask about details of the pool the answer we were given was, \""Well, we have one.\"" I will never stay here again and I will encourage my friends and family to do the same.",0
26482,Let me starting by saying that I wasn't expecting a mind blowing experience but I was expecting decent. We have limited delivery in our area and we wanted to try something different than your typical fast food chain delivery. Our experience was terrible. We live about ten minutes away and it took over an hour and 15 min get get our order. The caesar salad arrived with dressing on it that was like 3 times the amount of dressing anyone would want on their salad! Who delivers a salad with dressing on it? The pizza was vile. It tasted like soggy cardboard. There was no flavor what so ever and the basil on the too was charred and you couldn't even tell it was suppose to be green. Will not be visiting again.,0
7762,"I save one star reviews for exceptionally bad experiences and this was one of them. To make it short..it was over an hour before we had food on the table. I had to ask to get our order taken, then ask where our food was. It was EGGS people. It's breakfast. Not a sit down with a bottle of wine, have appetizers, chat... it was breakfast. For two people. My cousin and I walked in about 10am on a weekday. There were a ton of empty tables. We stood so long at the door with half a dozen staff people walking by us that I said \""this is a bad sign maybe we should go somewhere else.\"" And we really should have! When we finally got seated I had to ask for a waitress. After she appeared once she never came back. Until after I asked where our meal was. Usually in cases like this it's the processes that are bad not the people. But wow.. none the less... it was bad. Oh and the food.. was good. Not amazing. but good. But who cares by that time?",0
35757,"I ordered \""banh tam\""...which I usually have to make it at home because not all restaurants have it. I usually make mine w/shredded pork (bi) and meatballs (shrimp and ground pork). Well, this place didn't make it w/ meatballs, but it came with grilled pork! My eyes were wide open and I indulge right away! It was one of the best banh tam I ever had! I never thought of having grilled pork with it! Awesomness!!! Banh tam is served with mixed vegies, coconut milk, and nuoc mam (fish sauce). And they offered 2 free eggrolls if you check in! :)",4
14719,"Such a nice place to hang out and watch the holders below. The servers were great and the drinks were even better! We didn't eat there, but by the looks of it, everything looked so good!

Such a great restaurant/ bar!!",4
37759,"Beyond disgusting. Food was cold. And old. If you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again, you will love this place. Restaurant was filthy. And while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top. The restaurant was 3/4 empty and this was Friday night at 6:30. Save yourself and never come here. Can I give it less than 1 star?",0
16012,"We met up in Vegas with cousins of ours whose son travels frequently to Vegas on business. He recommended this restaurant, which is a block away from the Fremont Street Experience (see my review of that as well). The steaks were huge but even so, it was a little pricey for being off the strip. The service was average and the d\u00e9cor wasn't anything special and pretty plain (all deep brown wood which might appeal to some). I had the petite New York, which wasn't very petite and my husband had the ribeye, which he claimed was \""good for a ribeye,\"" whatever that means. I usually douse my steak in A1 but it sat untouched throughout my meal. I left wishing we had tried a different steakhouse. Measly servings of wine as well, but you're still overcharged for a full glass. Other than that, nothing much to write home about for this one. Wouldn't go back if we came to Vegas again.",1
8364,"Great beer selection. But if you are looking for more consistency, it is probably not the spot (they have a rotating tap selection). The food was actually quite wonderful. I didn't expect much for bar food, but was pleasantly surprised. I went with a large group and we had a great time drinking and answering trivia questions from one of their board games (there is a whole table full of games for customers to enjoy, yay!). I'd say the biggest downfall for this place is the atmosphere and service... there was pretty full crowd when I went in-and only 1 server for the whole place. Ridiculous. He was real nice and apologetic so we took it all in stride. But there were _long_ stretches where we didn't see him or get helped. He did his best to keep up, but it was a noticeable problem. Sure I'd go back, but never again when hungry. As for the atmosphere--the bar is a few steps up from a dive. Okay to hang out for locals, but not the place to impress. Friendly staff, good food and beer are enough to make you overlook this.",2

29151,"Went for lunch today for the first time. HMMMM expected a little more than we got. The service was great, but the food-so-so. Both the sandwich and salad were a bit dry. I asked for extra mayo but it never came. And COKE in a can for $2.50....come on, with those prices get a fountain. I probably won't be back.",1
16944,"Ok, so here's the deal: I really love their half priced bottles of wine on Sundays and because I am Italian, the bocci court is a nice touch...but that's kind of it. I think the food used to be way better and the service is, more times than not, lackluster. Maybe it's the atmosphere...I'm not a fan of the whole Scottsdale scene and this place reeks of Bro. I just think in a town where there are so many new restaurants popping up, you gotta step up your game. Get some more vegetarian options or revamp the menu with something a little more fresh. I won't refuse to return, but it is definitely not on the top of my list.",2
20308,"Ah, the perfect bite. Filet Mignon, Foi Gras, and Black Truffle. It was my first time trying Foi Gras and I was utterly stunned how good it was. Together with truffle and filet mignon, it truly was the perfect bite! I also had the sea bass which was really good, but not compared to the perfect bite. If you're gonna go here, you might as well get the best thing on the menu. Restaurant.com has $50 off $100 - you buy it for $10, so it's well worth it.",4
14481,"This was the worst most expensive dinner I have had. We went here because I had a $75 credit from a package deal so why not? Well, a couple mistakes, I order a glass of champagne, and get a bottle...including bottle price. second, my boyfriend and I both order pasta, (and really how hard is it to screw up pasta), but alas, it was so tasteless, luke warm, and chewy that we could not finish it. And 3rd, an appetizer to start the meal, prosciutto wrapped chicken, was so salty and I had nearly swallowed the salt shaker to make the saltiness go away. NEVER AGAIN.",0
606,"We were on our way back from a trip to Mexico and Cuba* when we arrived here for a short layover. This airport is easy to navigate, especially when you are coming through immigration -- there are lots of signs telling you exactly where to go. There was a long line at immigration but it moved fairly quickly. My honey and I had all of our research license paperwork in order for the Cuba portion of our travels in case we were asked for it** but the not-even-a-hello immigration officer guy just scanned our passports, looked at us with his best stern face, and stamped us on our way. We then picked up our checked suitcases, zoomed right through customs (after handing over our customs form) and rechecked our bags. The part that ended up taking the longest amount of time was going back through security, thanks to long lines. I do have to say that the security personnel were working very hard to move everyone along and were really nice as well. If we had more than 5 minutes to spare, I would have picked up some local BBQ to eat on our San Francisco bound flight. Thanks a lot, security line. *You won't hear much more about our trip to Mexico and Cuba since they don't have Yelp. (At least not yet.) I'll just summarize to say that almost everywhere we slept, ate, drank, visited, etc. were unquestionably five star. ** Apparently Beyonce and Jay Z did as well. http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/09/entertainment-us-usa-cuba-beyonce-idUSBRE93600V20130409",2

Many, many other tables had come and gone. Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait. The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free. We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue. It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue! Will not go back to this location ever!",1

I highly recommend you get here before everyone gets off work, because like any other downtown metor area, parking will be limited. Ambiance is what you should expect, dark/dim lighting, loud music, and crowded. Not too big of a deal because you will be so busy concentrating on demolishing your food any way. We have only been here 2 times and we have yet to try so many options here. There are so many different pizza combos to try, that you better bet we are coming back to eventually try it all. The combinations of flavors that they put on their pizza is awesome. Don't be afraid to add more protein...it might add that added Yum to your pizza. Whats important to me when I eat a pizza, its the crispiness of the crust. Thats exactly what you get, a nice crispy pizza. This place is a must try!",3
48350,Went with the my husband to check out the quad. Ventured over here for a bite. We sat at the bar and first off they bring water right away. Being a tree huger I'm a little torn by that. I do always ask for a water to start. I ordered the Palermo and my husband had Pancho Via. My drink was outstanding and made with great tequila. I think they make there own house brand. The Pancho via is jalape\u00f1o tequila watermelon and cucumber. Of course I had to try. So refreshing! I will definitely have some of those come summer time. We had the sopes and lobster tacos. Both were very good. Great dj and as others mentioned mechanical bull. Nice environment plus they have a little lounge area and balcony upstairs. This will be great in the summer. TIP: we parked at Cesar's forum shops valet and crossed the street. I think this might be the easiest parking.,4
19392,"This place has been open fro awhile now and I finally got to try it out. I was in the area with a friend of mine who constantly talked about how breat this places side dishes were. When we pulled up I was surprised to see the exterior of the building. Not so appealing from the outside, neither was the area it is in. The inside was much better but nothing like some of the places in LA this restaurant is based off of. The waitress that day seemed a gloomy and unwelcoming with her blank expressions and straight to the point service. I would have enjoyed the service a bit more if she was a bit more enthusiastic. It wasn't till the end of our meal when we engaged conversation with her that she cracked a smile. We ordered the tofu stew, since this is their specialty. I got the kimchee beef and my friend got the mushroom and beef. I like that they have the stone pots for the rice since no one else here in AZ does it. The rice came out a bit on the wet side but I was so hungry at this point it didn't matter. The sides that were presented to us was not very exciting. I don't know what all the hype was about the sides, it was just like any other place but a lot less. We only got 4 sides and one of them being roasted seaweed. Come on now, anyone can cut that up and serve it, I want something that I can't do at home. The stew was ok at best and did have a good amount of meat which is good. All in all the service was ok, could have been better if my water was ever refilled. The food was ok nothing too exciting. A good place to go if you live in the area but like most of us who do not, not worth the drive. Possibly a harsh review since there are only a few Korean places in town but wouldn't you think since there are only a handful here and for some reason they all do tofu stew and a specialty that one would get it right. or at least enough for AZ but not this one to say the least.",1
5143,"First off, reading these reviews, take them for seriousness with a grain of salt. Comparing Boston with Pizza Hut? Reviews from Coneheads from the planet Kolob, is more like it. And customer service? These people don't try to kiss your ass, they know they have great pizza, you want it or not, and I am fine with that, I don't like ass kissers. The pizza is great, lots a cheese, lotsa toppings, great crust, decent delivery, and an offer you can't refuse on Tuesdays, 2 for 1. Two thumbs up for Boston Pizza. The rest of you can go get a chain store pizza.",4

She was rude and took order only from those standing \""directly\"" in front of her... then told us that she was out of Oreos and Twinkies. Really?? I could of swore I saw a few boxes full of them behind her to her right... but clearly she wasn't having any of it. Didn't stay to play in the casino. They did give out mardi gras beads though.",0
48600,"An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi. Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle) with sauces that mask the taste of the seafood. Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice. The nigiri rundown: Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked. Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints. Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp). Vegas style rolls are a disaster. The \""dragon roll\"" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the \""Jack Pot Special\"" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more. Fun ambiance. Fast service at the sushi bar. $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner. There is a time limit for ordering. It was not enforced on two visits. Falling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters.",1

In addition they made me do a hearing test which came back normal (which btw that lady treated me like I was 5 years old and special needs).

41213,"A small airline delivering low budget service at big boy prices but always with a smile, until something goes wrong. A flying bus. No frills. No food service menu. No wine list. No toothbrushes or personal mouthwash in the lavatories. Just horrible airline food and a very limited selection of drinks. They even charge you for a blanket (but you can keep it). What they lack in amenities, they usually make up for in service with some of the friendliest and warmest employees bar none.

NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT. 5:45pm: Text message received from Hawaiian announcing further delay but promises update at 6:30pm. 6:30pm: .......... 7:15pm: Flight attendants wandering around the terminal talking to groups who look like they are from Hawaii. People start to gather at the podium. NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT. 7:30pm: Everyone on their phone at the podium. Better see what is happening. Told the flight has been grounded. Passengers must pickup luggage by a grouchy agent (\""stop making me repeat myself, just follow everyone else and get your bags\""). Take a shuttle to a hotel that will leave in 15 minutes (it takes that long to get to baggage claim). Flight rescheduled to 7am next day. Everyone must be back at the airport by 5am. The supervisor says they are some seats available on the midnight flight so those with high mileage status should wait. 8:00pm: Finally speak to an agent. No seats on any flight for three days. I know because she just told the person in front of me but still she types stuff into the computer when I'm standing in front of her just to give me the same information. Better still \""the shuttle has left. You need to go to XXX hotel, find a Hawaiian agent so they can get you checked in then get your meal vouchers\"" Sorry, I don't play Where's Waldo. Opt to get my own room at Mandalay Bay. 5:00am: At the airport. No Hawaiian agents at the counter. No 7:00am flight listed on the departure board. 5:30am: Still no agents. Call 800 number. Between the \""your flight was rescheduled?\"" and the \""your last name begins with the letter U as in ...\"" Hang up. 6:00am: Agent arrives. Flight has been rescheduled to 12:45pm. \""If you went to the hotel with everyone else you would have known that\"". When I ask why the didn't text us like they did the night before, I get told \""We don't do that\"". I show him my phone. \""You must have sent that to yourself\"". 6:15am: Agent logged in and ready to deliver excellent customer service. I ask if the rescheduled flight is really leaving at 12:45. \""Doubtful, the mechanic is being flown in from Hawaii and has not even landed yet.\"" Enough is enough. Rebooked flight days later. But there is a happy ending... 8:00am: In taxi back to Mandalay Bay on phone with VIP host. Within five minutes, second room booked, and upgraded to suites, immediate check in assured, and requested fresh juices and fruits to be in suite by the time we open the door. Huge props to Hawaiian's providing generous $300 per person compensation for the problems when they are under NO obligation to do so (Department of Transportation: http://www.usa.gov/topics/travel/air/resolve-problems/flight.shtml ). Shamefully poor customer service handling the problems.",1
16008,These people love what they do and it shows. One of the best places in Madison for a create your own deli sandwich - hot and cold.\r \r High quality natural and organic meats and cheeses help this deli stand out. And the customer service! These guys are fantastic and totally into what they're doing - making for a fun visit. \r \r I love Artamos Deli.,4
23586,"I like that this location is a few miles away from the strip. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's just easier to be on the strip where all the action is, but sometimes after a long day of food, alcohol, and SMOKE, i just need to get out of there and go somewhere that reminds me the comforts of home which is what this place does! You are only a FEW miles away from the strip, it's really not that far. the units have everything you expect a worldmark property to have, full kitchen, laundry appliances, deck, etc. and of course it's spacious. so if you don't want to cram 4 people into one open room, and stay in a hotel that reeks of smoke and booze, I would definitely recommend staying here. Note: for those that like to gamble in the morning, afternoon, and night, this is probably not the place for you since they have no slots or tables, FYI.",3
42513,"Pizza was good the night off, but really fell off a cliff the following day. I think good pizza is just as good if not better the next day, as much can be concealed with a hot pie. Our server was excellent, very attentive, not very impressed with lack of subs on the specialty pies. We did a substitution but charged us additional for our choice of topping which I thought was weird. Also far too many red onions on their veggie pie. NO BUFFALO WINGS!!??",1
24323,"For a company \""cafe\""teria... this is not a bad place. For its convenience since it's on campus and their daily specials change weekly. The prices are kinda steep but that's the price you pay for convenience and the lack of nearby restaurants that are less than 15 mins away. I've tried their \""home\"" section with their roasted pork sirloin or oven roasted chicken, it's actually edible, not excellent but it's good nonetheless. I sometimes feel at times depending on the time of day, the choices become limited and they really do not accommodate those who have lunch after 1pm. Some soups are alright too mainly their clam chowder and their chicken noodle. They're satisfactory. But the prices are killer but I am accustomed to this since I previously worked at the ASU tempe campus and the prices at the memorial union were quite steep as well. So if you're looking for a place for a quick lunch or something to pick up to bring back to your desk, this is not a bad alternative.",2
30318,"This is my new fave hotel. The staff is stupendous. Did u notice that the front girls are fraternal twins? They know how to give excellent service with courtesy & sincerity. The king room is standard Hilton with a serenity bed but the property is 1 yr old from Feb 2009. It's pleasant with a decent $89-129 rate that I scanned to know when we should come. We had breakfast at The Grill wihich has a nice variable menu with my Caprese egg white Benedict being brilliant,",3
42938,"Went into this restuarant with high hopes. I've passed by it walking on 5th a few times and it always looks elegant and busy, so when my company offered to treat our whole office to dinner on them, I suggested 5Church. Mandi Bane, the sales director, assisted me with coordinating it and was absolutely wonderful. I must've sent her a dozen emails with changes and updates on our party and reservation. We were going to be a party of 11 on a Thursday evening at 8:15 PM. Kudos to 5Church for accepting my company's strange request of paying via check, too! You made life so much easier on an accounting level! We arrived feeling like rock stars and were treated as such. We had our own area of the upstairs and each couple had their own individual table in a U-shaped which was so unique. Brandon, our server, had all the instructions about our party and payment and he was incredible. Attentive, knowledgeable, patient...honestly, best service EVER. We started with drinks and one of my guests ordered 2 bottles of bubbly. Brandon poured our glasses, we toasted, and then....warm champagne hit my palate. Something was said and one of the managers (I'm assuming) hurriedly came out with another bottle that was slightly more chilled. Very classy. I ordered a beverage called the Viper, a trendy concotion of cucumber and tequila with a surprising kick of pepper. It was unique. Soooo....why only 3 stars? Well, because frankly the food was terrible. We had heard about the 60-second strip steak and ordered it medium rare which we knew would come out close to moo-ing. We didn't know it would be served almost raw and cold. I was expecting it to be seared on the outside (so hot) and cool on the inside. It was served on top of mashed potatoes-also cold. And the sauce tasted like a jazzed up version of A-1. (My apologies to the chef, but it has to be said). Of the four people in our party that ordered 2 sent it back and requested it be taken off the bill. Me and my boyfriend choked it down, but was displeased with the entree after having such high hopes. I will say that I will probaly go back for drinks and an appetizer. We did share the meat tray and that was lovely. I told Brandon that the proscitto was the best I had ever had. As for service and atmosphere, 5Church really shined, but the entree of the hyped up steak was a major letdown.",2
23021,I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place. Everything about it was horrible. The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever. The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered. The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down. Complete waste of money and time.,0
5144,"Delivery said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again",0
4227,"Visited for a full set of silk nails, she automatically put acrylic on my nails not the silk I had asked for. I didn't ask for them to be taken off because the whole point of silk nails is they are less damaging than acrylic but when I told her I asked for silk she said I asked for acrylic. I would never say acrylic if I wanted acrylic I would just say full set. So I didn't argue but my acrylic nails turned out very thick and bumpy. Had to go to another salon to they them thinned up and smoothed out. She also left them very long after I asked her to cut them shorter and made my cuticles bleed. After I pulled my hand away she said she was doing it on purpose because my nail sea are too short so she was \""helping me\"".",1
31386,My husband is so obsessed with this restaurant! It may not look like much from the outside but it is fantastic! My husband got the full rack of ribs and I got the Pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were great. My obsession from this place is definitely the corn bread It is so sweet...almost like cake :) && I love cake! Definitely a great place to try if you are looking for a local joint with awesome food!!,4
37662,"For those of us spoiled by the original Los Angeles Comme Ca, please be advised you will not have the same experience. This version rests among many other restaurants on a floor dedicated to food at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Everyone and I mean everyone on that floor is just about dining - never experienced that before as the hotels usually spread out their eateries. Las week, we were greeted by a friendly hostess, however we wound up having to wait an additional 30-40 mins because our table was not yet available for whatever reason (this is with a reservation for 9PM). We wound up having a drink in the bar featuring the worlds slowest bartenders (I'm not kidding - wish I was). The wine selection is apparently nothing compared to the LA location so again, be prepared for a step down experience. Once we were finally seated, the view was nice overlooking the strip. The menu is varied with many good options - very similar if not the same as LA. Our server was friendly but a little tweaked out. After being served the first course in a normal time period, we waited and waited and waited for the entree course. Finally I flagged our server only to be approached by the manager who asked if we were heading to a show - no apology, no explanation, just that one question - was quite odd. Hint readers...always tell them you are heading to a show and they will serve you in a more timely manner. Dinner finally came and was quite tasty. We skipped the desserts because we didn't want to risk the wait. Overall, the food is good, the ego is typical Vegas and I'd return - just ensuring I have nothing on the agenda for the remainder of the night. If in LA, be sure to visit the location on Melrose - its superb.",2
33298,"I like Buffalo Wild Wings. I've never really had a problem at one before. But this was a pretty terrible experience. I was able to get a table no problem, and the server came out pretty quickly. But it went downhill from there. Once I ordered, it took a really long time to get my food. Then, when it did come out, half of my order was wrong. So I had to wait again to get the rest of my order. My food was delivered to my table in three separate trips. No apology for the wait, no discount. So I finally finish my food, get a to-go box for the half of my order that was received last so I'd already eaten the rest of it, and pay. Then when my transaction hits my bank, I realized they'd overcharged me. There were two transactions for BWW on my bank account instead of one. Just a bad experience all around. I won't be back.",1
22151,"I wanted to see \""O\"" but my boyfriend's lackluster response, made me think that LOVE would be a better compromise, considering the Beetles theme. I'd seen Varekai at Marymoor Park in the Seattle area before, so I knew what we were in for and I was pretty excited. The show was cool, but is definitely more musical production style than traditional cirque du soleil style. The soundtrack is amazing of course! I think I was just looking forward to more acrobatics than dancing, so I was a little let down. So, yes, it's good, but if you like the bendy wendy types that are normally in these performances, LOVE may not be your best choice.",2
38411,"I'm a little surprised that no one else Yelping in this area has stumbled upon ZBA, especially considering that there isn't really much else like it in the 28105. Looks like it's up to me to get things started! ZBA is a little international grocery right on the corner of Independence and Sam Newell in Matthews. As I said, it's pretty unique for the area. It's small but there's a lot of stuff packed into it. The majority of what ZBA carries is Middle Eastern (of the Sadaf brand), but there's a random smattering of European and Asian items, as well as some pretty mundane items such as Coke, toiletries, and auto supplies (!). I struggled with myself over whether ZBA deserved 3 stars or 4 stars. On one hand, the prices are good (usually, but not always, cheaper that Harris Teeter's ethnic section), and the owner is truly friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the stock is kind of haphazard and unfocused. I think ZBA would greatly benefit from concentrating in one area and discarding the American and non-food items. After all, it is sandwiched between the Matthews and North Sardis HTs, with a Pep Boys and Sams Club on either side of the road as well. This space could be used to carry a wider range of the unique items that one can't really get elsewhere in Matthews. However--and please heed this part of my review if no other--ZBA is worth a trip if only for the GREAT prices on their wide variety of dried spices. Seriously. You can get good-sized bags of spices for as little as 99 cents each. The deals are so good that ZBA has become my first stop whenever I need to replenish my spice rack or need something for a new culinary endeavor. Their tahini is also sold for significantly less than you'll find it at a generic supermarket. Drop by and give ZBA a chance. They do have some truly good deals, despite the clutter. And hey, you could always pick up some Armor All with that tub of tumeric.",2
40049,"If I could give negative stars, I would. I rarely order delivery pizza, and even less from Dominoes. The last time I ordered from there my pizza was delivered over an hour late and was cold. That was nearly 6mos ago. Today I pre-ordered for a specific time. It came on time but as a cash delivery. I had ordered with a credit card online. The delivery man called the store manager and she said it was entered as cash. Meanwhile, I brought my laptop to the door to show it was entered as credit card, but after hearing the manager speaking about me (he had the speaker phone on) I just shoved the food back to him and said \""forget it, you guys just can't get this right.\"" Perhaps I was rude, but if they want customers they need to up their game. Had to call my bank to make sure no charges went/go through seeing as how I entered all my info on their website.",0
28294,"I was here this past Saturday (10/5) at around 1:00pm. Every time I go to Vegas I love to get Pina Coladas from the various hotel bars to compare. I was gambling at the Stratosphere so I decided to stop here to give their pina coladas a try. There were two bartenders on duty. One older guy and one younger guy. Both were horrible! First of all, they were totally uninterested in the bar and its customers. They seemed to only be interested in each other and huddling up to talk to each other on the other side of the bar where nobody was sitting. People, such as myself, would come up to order a drink and they never checked on customers or anything. I stood there for close to 10 minutes before this guy who had been at the bar with his girlfriend for a while drinking and playing games, whistled to get the younger guy's attention to come serve me. He finally comes over there and walked over to them and said, \""What do you need?\"" They said, \""Dude we don't need anything, but you have a customer that has been standing here for the longest time waiting to be served.\"" So he looked over at me and hesitantly walked up. He still didn't say anything. He didn't greet me or say, \""Can I get you something?\"" NOTHING! He just stood there with this blank look on his face like he couldn't IMAGINE what I might want from him??!! So I said, \""Um, I would like to order drinks\"". And he said, \""Oh...drinks?\"" AS IF this was news to him that someone would come up to a damn bar to order DRINKS??!! So I ordered my drinks for myself and the person I was with. So he made the drinks and never ONCE made eye contact or exerted any sort of true customer service. He just rang me up. The damn pina colada was $9.75 and it was below mediocre. argh I went ahead and tipped him because if I didn't, I know his lame ass would have probably blamed it on me being black and NOT on the fact that he's a lousy bartender that gave shitty, dismissive service! On top of that, while I was standing there waiting for my drinks to be made, the older guy argued with this couple about the amount they charged them for their drinks. They were arguing that because they were playing video poker (or whatever game it was up there) that they shouldn't be charged full price for their drinks. They were saying that they were staying at the hotel and the night before they paid less than $9 for the same drinks BECAUSE they were playing video poker. But on that day, this older guy was charging them $12 for their drinks. The older guy was very gruff in his tone when telling them there was NO WAY they could have paid anything below $9.75 for their drinks. So he was basically calling them liars. When they tried to appeal to the younger guy, he was confused as hell. In one breath he was telling them they charge less if you're playing games at the bar...and in the next breath he was telling them they had to pay full price for their drinks? They were pissed. Anyway, the bartender that I had to deal with was named Ben. Steer clear of his clueless, non customer service having ass! I don't know what their deal was that day but they pissed me off. All I wanted was a pina colada and instead I was treated like I was a nuisance to them! So weird!",0
46026,"What a huge disappointment on all levels. From the moment we sat down I could see the level of filth between the banquets. Our service was poor, uninformed and slow to the point of feeling ignored. Our server could not explain the signature cocktail saying \""I think it has gin in it\"" The food was just fair and in fact, the frites were served cold and limp. We were asked upon making the reservation if this was a special occasion. We said yes, it was my birthday. Our server did acknowledge my birthday but never offered dessert to our table. No one stopped by the table at any time to ask how our meal was and frankly, it's a good thing or I would have let them have it. I would say it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Don't waste your time or your money on this place.",0

I stopped in here very impromptu on my way home. It seemed to look like any other nail salon: bland, fake plants, stacks of old magazines, but the pedicure stations looked pretty clean so I sat down. For some reason I felt the need to apologized for my ugly nails telling her that running has ruined them. She said dancers have the same problem. At least I'm not a total mutant. She did a nice job with the polish, although the rest of the pedicure was kind of lacking. For the massage part it was more like just putting lotion on than an actual massage. $24 for basic pedicure.",1

We went there for a little gambling and a dinner special they were having and due to their limited availability we did not get the special. We decided to just gamble a bit. After finally looking for someone we ordered a coffee at the bar. It was 11pm at night and we were told the kitchen was closed. They actually told us its too late for coffee. We gambled a little more and this place just gave us the creeps. Here is the thing... We came up with friends recently (a few weeks after our original encounter). We never said anything about our experience and our friends asked if we could go to another casino because they didn't like the \""feel\"" of the casino. It was then we told our story and took off.",1
13435,"Minus one star for the slowness of service and the room in general. I get that things need to be cooked to order, but some attentiveness in between or acknowledgment that it had taken over 30 minutes for us to get from the first course to the next one would have been nice. Also, I felt like I was sitting in the lap of one of the people in the table next to me. We basically had to maneuver our table in order to go to the bahtroom and I'm a small person -- I cannot imagine what someone of normal height would have to do. It's also not as if we were a surprise guest -- I made my reservations well in advance. Thanks to the food, both of these issues were very much overshadowed. Our meals began with their squash soup shooter and bread amuse bouche. Both were great. Then came the bread platter. Amazing. Between my boyfriend and I we tried all of them, our favorites being the bacon one (bacon!!!) and the lemon/rosemary one. For my first course I had their seared foie dish. It was superb. Su-perb. The boy got the fruit de mer bowl and all in all it was good but not impressive since we hail from the land of seafood. The highlight of it though was the tuna in the middle. It melted in your mouth. My main course was the duck. That was also great. Well seasoned and the confit of some of the leftovers that they gave me was also very good. My boyfriend's rabbit was also very well done. He had never had rabbit before and enjoyed it quite a bit. By the time dessert arrived, we were both sufficiently stuffed. I ordered the chocolate souffle and it was everything I had hoped for. Rich. Creamy in the middle. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Sphere which was not only rich and tasty but also really cool to watch as they poured the sauce over it. I really like the petit fours at the end but they seemed a bit overkill given how rich everything else was. The mini jewelry box with truffles was also a nice added touch.",3
17193,"Agave-how I wish it weren't so: 1. Terrible service- no hostess when we arrived. No utensils when we received our food. No server to take our payment. Everything was just slow. I'm wasn't in a hurry, but having to wait for everything makes any average person a little anxious. 2. Food- Crispy quesadillas - chicken and corn versions: nice corn masa shell but bland fillings. Then we had the fresh fish tacos. They were soggy and a mess. The fish had an old fishy flavor and I couldn't get past it. If I'm able to eat fish sauce like it's ketchup, I think I have a pretty good tolerance of seafood/ocean taste. 3. Ambience- surprisingly nice. From the exterior, I wouldn't never have thought it was that well put-together in the interior. It was a great blend of the colors, the lighting and a Large center bar. But I'm here for food first and thought did not impress.",1

Otherwise, the American Kobe style rib eye was the best piece of steak I have ever had. Having already had A5 (highest rated cut) kobe/wagyu beef in japan and Hong Kong numerous times, I was skeptical that any other beef would excite me, however the American Kobe had the best of both worlds. The marbling and fat of a Japanese Kobe beef and the beefy robust taste of a Angus beef. I would choose the American Kobe Style rib eye over Japanese Kobe/wagyu steak. Don't bother with the tasting of Sirloin, I ordered that and ended up enjoying my girlfriends American Kobe rib eye instead. The bone marrow flan and desert were pretty good as well.

I want to love it because it's in my back yard, too! However, First Friday leaves me with a sense of empty feeling. Located in the arts district downtown should be plenty of reason why this event should boast art, but it doesn't. The art galleries are lacking, and the street vendors that sell art are more there to just get a buck than they are about art. Then there's the riff raff of downtown trying to join in, and so many kids everywhere! I guess police try to crack down on curfew, but there's always so many grungy kids that are up to no good running around. The food stalls are nice during summer hours, winter many vendors decide to stay home.

18800,"Had heard alot of good things about this place so gave it a try. Pretty dissapointing to say the least. I ordered the club sandwich and unlike any other club sandwich Ive ordered elsewhere this was pretty much just a turkey sandwich, very little ham and a few small pieces of bacon. Arent \""club\"" sandwiches supposed to be tall double deckers?? This looked like something I would make at home. Definetly not an $8 plus sandwich. Hubby had a turkey burger, which again at about $8 bucks looked about the size of a regular hamburger at McDonalds. Red Robin burgers are a million times better for the same price. The onion rings were soggy and greasy and most of the batter had fallen off. One bright spot was the slice of pizza we ordered. Hubby said it was yummy. All in all this is one of those places where I just dont get what people like about it. Food was very blah and not worth the money. Maybe its good for drinks and happy hour appetizers but dont waste your time or money for a meal, there are much better places to go for less money.",0
28819,"Beautiful hotel, nice decor. Pros, clean, modern, nice casino. Cons, small rooms, trying to do too much in too little space, the scents they have pumping through the casino and lobby areas are nice at first, but then become overwhelming throught the day and the rest of the stay. It actually started to make me feel a little quesy sometimes, and I don't have anything close to a weak stomach! The walk from the front doors to the strip is about a half mile long! I don't think I'd stay here again, I wasn't hugely turned off by it or anything, I just wasn't very impressed. But then again, this is back when it first opened and everyone was making such a huge deal about the newly built city center. It was just Meh in my book.",2
12458,Maybe expectation is too high on the name 'Nobu'. The black cod with miso was just okay - nothing special really. The sushi is good. Nothing really 'wow' me.. We had Tapan's dinner too... again.. it was so-so. The bill came to 170 for the 2 of us. Oh.. talked about the atmosphere. It's noisy and not well decorated at all =(,1
34523,"Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia. It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians. Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown. They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown. This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler. Proof that sequels can be better than the original. (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.) Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant. The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz. The drinks are all well poured. The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced. The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point. I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too. Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home. He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it. ...And i lived happily ever after.",4
12211,I ordered delivery from this place - about $35 worth of sushi and food. When the delivery driver came to our apartment I asked for change on $40 and I was going to give him a tip. The delivery driver (shorter asian man) started YELLING at me about how he drove across town and he couldn't believe I was going to give him less than a $5 tip. Are you kidding me sir? I don't technically have to tip you at all! The guy was extremely rude and I will NEVER order from this location again. Tip: Go to the Edo location on Monona drive! They have always been great and have awesome customer service!,0
42070,"People creep into your room and steal your property. hotel doesn't allow you to report it. Do not stay here it is creepy and unsafe. This Dana George who commented below me was rude, unresponsive, and accusational. She did not help, none of her staff were capable of following simple protocol because I was transferred between her and her head of security more than three times due to them both claiming it was the others responsibility to help. They promised to call me back and never did. My girlfriend had her Tiffany necklace stolen out from her own locked room. that's a violation of safety as well as property. Imagine if she was awake or had woken up.. what could have happened to a woman in her room that doesn't lock in Las Vegas alone? Especially with such apathetic staff? Of course if you try explaining these concerns to DGeorge she will apathetically wonder what to do and transfer you to security because she's incapable of facing these issues on her lonesome. Do not stay here for your own safety. It would be one thing if the staff were at all concerned with YOU. Your family, your daughters, your wife, your property, are at risk in this hotel. They ignored our requests, ignored our asking for help, and Elara staff especially their general manager are incompetent and should NOT be allowed around other human beings. That means Dana George DGeorge@hotel manager.",0
31586,"Decided to stop by based on all the great reviews. First off a small joint , clean and friendly. I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. The burger was quite large and plenty of chili however the taste left something to be desired. It tasted like...maybe the meat had been cooked with onions and peppers used on hogie style sandwiches, bad blend of something that left a bad taste. Oh well, onto the next burger joint.",1
44266,I first went here on a Groupon and now come on a weekly basis. My girl does such a great job on my mink lashes and I always get compliments!!! I couldn't ask for a better professional and very nice staff. I'm always looking ready to go out because of this wonderful business. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!!!!! You will get hooked too :),4
3717,"I have finally found my groomer!! This place is absolutely amazing. The service here is TOP quality.. Absolutely no complaints. I always schedule my appointments with Addie. With her work, you can definitely see how much she cares. My Yorkie, Preston, was given the best hair cut he has even seen. My Yorkie-Poo's hair cut was spot on. She cut his hair right on the very first time... It literally took my last groomer 3 attempts before she finally gave me what I wanted. If you're in the market for a new groomer, for whatever reason, I highly recommend you trying this place out. I can call in the morning and they can get me in the same day. If I need a quick nail trimming, all I do is stop in and they will take a quick break to trim the nails. Support this locally owned and operated salon - you'll be so happy that you did :)",4
40553,"My girlfriend and I had been visiting this restaurant since it open. It was a favorite spot up until a couple of months ago. Recently, the service has taken a turn for the worst. The past three times it seems that Anime Ramen doesn't have enough wait staff or kitchen workers. We've waited about half an hour several occasions to have our food orders taken and another half an hour for the food to be prepared. Most recently, I left after not getting service at my table for over 15 minutes, not even a drink order taken, nor a hello after being pointed to sit at a table; the tables around us seemed to have waiters, but not us for some reason. It's sad because we loved to come here, but after this latest experience, we no longer feel that the great tasting food and low prices are worth the wait.",1
10897,"Salsa was ok. Tomatillo was excellent. Rice and beans were bland. Steak taquitos were good and shrimp not so much. Get over the water charge folks... it is what 'tis. Waitress was tad pushy by upselling us to the moon and i didn't like that. Knife had crusty food on it, they replaced it but still gross.",1
2246,"The Good: Free wi-fi, fairly easy to get around (Terminal 4), Decent dining options (Terminals 3 and 4) The Bad: Parking in their garage can cost you dearly, relocation of offsite parking shuttles, terminal 3's somewhat confusing layout, Terminal 2 Being a person who frequents this airport, I can tell you it is not Incheon nor Dubai. However, it is a decent sized facility that can accommodate larger aircraft. Many of the gates now have newer jetways to accommodate the larger A321s and could easily accommodate the A330s/340s. Food options are decent, even though scarce in some terminals. However, that is changing. They are building restaurants such as McDonald's and adding new ones such as Starbucks. Even baggage claim has a Starbucks. The above is mostly about Terminal 4 but Terminal 3 has good food options but the terminal is very dated. Has a fairly confusing layout to the unfamiliar. Terminal 2 is even more dated. Shame that United and other carriers use this terminal when spaces are available at 3. One of the biggest problems I have with the airport is how the off-site parking shuttles are positioned. The best way to describe the area is chaotically dangerous. It is literally at the end of the airport where traffic at different points merges and in front of the corporate cars. Just imagine a parking or hotel shuttle trying to get in and a corporate car trying to get out with traffic whizzing past between 35-50 mph. Herding cats would be more orderly.",2
569,"I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen, but I have been listening to Jazz a lot lately and got in the mood for some live Jazz. From what I have been able to find, this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz, so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night. No problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there, but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a \""20-30 minute wait\"" for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs, right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go, as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand. Our dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned, but still tasted very bland to me, especially the crawfish, which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.) I was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen, and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food, although I was full. Given that \""Live Jazz 7 nights a week\"" is prominently touted on their website header, they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation, if I had known that was the only place to hear the music. Either that, or they need to remodel that old, bland house to open it up more. Bottom line: I will not be going back.",1

35842,"Stumbled upon this place whilst looking for a gift for a friend who's big into whiskies so figured I couldn;t go wrong. I don;t know anything about whisky but the staff were really helpful, and knew their stuff so I managed to come out with a decent bottle. They didn't push me into buying the really expensive ones either, which I'd expected. I noticed they weren't overly pushy with other customers too, leaving them to browse if they didn't want any help when asked. The selection of miniatures and big bottles is huge, and they have lots more besides whisky. There's a note next to each type, explaining a bit more about it, which I thought was a nice touch, saving you having to ask all the time. would definitely go back for another present - great selection, nice staff, good prices.",4
38975,"I only live two blocks from Local Bar & Kitchen, so I'd been eagerly monitoring the progress of its construction throughout fall and winter. When the bar finally opened for St. Patrick's Day weekend, I enjoyed some cocktails on the superb rooftop deck. I had not properly dined there, however, until this past Friday evening. I arrived with two friends around 7pm and was immediately greeted by the sickly sweet smell of vomit. That was almost enough to turn us away, but since we were immediately seated at a prime table overlooking Carson Street, we decided to stick it out. In spite of the early hour, club-style music was blaring and we were forced to shout to hear one another. Thankfully the restaurant boasts a decent selection of beers on tap. (Stella Artois is suprisingly elusive in the 'burgh.) However, when the beer arrived my friend's glass was literally covered in lipstick marks. Strike two! We ordered food which arrived quickly considering the packed space. The menu boasts that its salads are \""made with the freshest locally grown Anthony's Original Produce.\"" Unfortunately, my Speedy Southwest Salad tasted anything but fresh. The lettuce was limp, the tomatoes were mushy, and the grilled chicken, which I chose to add, was rubbery and burnt. My companions' burgers, although large, didn't taste much better. It's truly a shame that the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the space and utensils was so poor, because, in spite of the noisy soundtrack, the atmosphere of Local is pretty great. It's a mix of rustic and industrial chic, with wide plank wood floors, large iron gears bolted to the walls, and exposed beams and funky metal light fixtures on the ceiling. Assuming the vomit smell can be got under control, it's not a bad place for an after work cocktail or late night libation. Once the weather is consistently warm, patrons can avoid indoor smells altogether and enjoy the fantastic view from the restaurant's best asset, its rooftop deck.",1
13413,"Stopped by here for lunch on a weekday. No reservations were required and we stepped right in to an open table. We had the carpaccio and it was delicious. My friend also had the scallops, which were served in risotto. This was a very well made dish, texture and taste wise. I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes scallops and risotto. We also ordered the truffle fries which were potato wedges with truffles as well as a flat bread. Both were good. The flat bred resembles a pizza and makes a good appetizer for a party of 3-4. One of the best parts of Olives is the view of the Bellagio fountains. Sitting inside, the backdrop of this restaurant are the fountains. Probably very romantic at night. There's also balcony seating and I would love to try to get a table on the balcony next time, if it's not too hot. Overall, very recommended!",4
5187,"It's been a while since I've updated my review for Komol, so here we go. The food is still delicious! I finally got to try the herbal salad, since I'm attempting to eat healthier lately. It was refreshing and absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was delicious. My dining companions got the mee krob to start and the spicy mint chicken, pork pad thai and some chicken dish that escapes me at the moment. All were incredibly happy with their meals. I took some garlic fried rice with beef home to my fella as well. I took a few bitefuls of that as well and love it! The service can be hit or miss here, but they were extremely attentive on this visit and refilled our water glasses regularly. They were pretty packed for the holidays and seemed to accomodate the large amount of guests quite nicely. Definitely still one of my favorites!",4
46836,"Seriously good sandwiches. I had an A Wreck Sub with Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, and ham for five bucks you kidding me! Added bacon for $1.25 and it was some of the best bacon I've ever had.

39247,"If I could give this location zero stars I would. This location contained the most incompetent string of FedEx employees I have ever had the unfortunate \""luck\"" to encounter. It started with tracking the package I was expecting just to see that it was listed as 'Incorrect Address'. My first thought was how could this be? I had made sure the address was listed correctly when I placed the order and when I received the shipment notification it also had the correct address. When I called the customer service center they told me that the note on the shipment was that my shipping address did not include a building number. In my complex, we do have unit #'s and building #'s. The unit #'s and building #'s do not repeat. The building #'s are used to narrow down which area of the complex you are in but you can still locate a unit without the building #. I have lived in this complex for 3 years and the only time I've used the building # is when I have a visitor or I am ordering take-out food. This was not the first thing I've had shipped to this apartment and this was the first time I've had this problem. Obviously the driver was new and didn't know the area, too lazy to ask the security guards for directions, ask the renters office for help, or just didn't feel like doing their work today. The customer service agent let me know that they could put a note on this shipment so that as soon as the package was returned to the shipment center, I would be notified by text or email and would be able to go pick up the package in person. I never received the notice. I took a change and went to the FedEx location hoping that my package would have been returned to the shipment center. Turns out that the package had returned to the center 45 mins before I even got there yet, still to this day, no email, phone call or text was ever received as I was promised. The gentlemen at the counter who was assisting me in retrieving the box took at look at my tracking # and ID and proceeded to the back to look for the box. When he came back out 10 mins later, he said he couldn't find it because he did not write down the tracking # and needed the information again. Wouldn't it have been important information to take down the first time around instead of wasting 10 minutes?!?! When he finally found it, he scanned the label, I signed to say I received it and as I took possession of the box, he grabbed it out of my hands so he could verify the name on the box again. REALLY?!?! That information should have been checked, double checked and tripped checked before even handing me the package and having me sign for it. I will avoid shipping with FedEX and especially to this location for the rest of my life.",0

We started our meals with Loubie Bzeit for our appetizer. Green beans sauteed with onions, herbs, large whole cloves of garlic (Mmmm! Kiss me Rick, Darling!). Since I like the basics, I had the chicken vegetable soup. To tell you the truth, I prefer chicken noodle any day of the week. I had my usual here, the grilled turkey salad. Aladdin's still isn't my first choice for dining out, but it is a nice change of pace from your standard burger joint.",2

My friend was coherent and civil. Even the servers agreed with us and told us not to pay any gratuity. We even spoke to head of security who sided with that asshole.

33302,"Worst Experience ever!!!! I would only recommend this office to my worst enemy. They have a shady practice. My husband went in in August. They told him they were charging him our $50 copayment and charged $600 to our debit card. Ok people make mistakes and I can give a second chance. When I went in in January for a chipped tooth. I was unable to print off the new patient paperwork because of the format they had it in online. In not so many words the office staff said I was stupid. They refured me to another office to get a root canal ( Bradford endodontics ..,,, they were great by the way). Four months later after being rescheduled I went in for my temporary crown, which I was fitted for and paid for ( $200 more than quoted price). I figured I would only have to be in there one more time then I was done and would never have to deal with them again. The next day they called and told me the dr they sent me to for the root canal had sent them a letter saying my wisdom teeth needed to be pulled in order to put on the crown. NOTHING had been said about them during the visit. I was given no options, just this has to be done . When I asked to speak to the dentist they said that wasn't possible without an appointment. I called the office that had supposedly sent over the letter, they had nothing on file stating that I needed my wisdom teeth pulled. So here I sit with a temporary crown, and out $600.Not sure what Im gonna do next , but i do know onething, I will be reporting them to the BBB.",0
6768,"I've been out in California for the last three years, but I lived in Madison back when Bluephies first opened in 1994, and have sampled it pretty regularly over the various chef/menu changes. The last time I came here for dinner, it was a pleasure. I associated Bluephies with fresh local greens, unique flavors that favored aioli and tapenade over mayo, and especially over-the-top breakfast yumminess. Alas, whatever's happened to dinner in the last year and a half, is totally depressing. My fiance, my mother, and my two stepkids and I went the last night (8/11) we were in Madison before flying back here. I ordered an apple chicken walnut salad sandwich, which used to be a pretty awesome blend of aioli and a locally baked croissant with mixed greens, with an interesting presentation. What I got, was something substandard to the airport food that we had at Denver International Airport, and more expensive to boot. The chicken salad was totally overwhelmed with mayo, the lettuce flabby, and the croissant one of those commercial flabby affairs. The kids menu dinner items were horrifying; the cheese quesadilla and pizza were microwaved and pretty darn tiny. My mother's the most forgiving person when it comes to restaurants, but her salmon wasn't good either. My fiance's meal was totally over-mayoed as well. The waitress staff were good, and one waitress who had been there for 2 1/2 years said that it wasn't what it used to be. And when we complained about the quality of the food, they took off one plate from the price. I know times are tough, but even out here people have the sense that if you want people to try to get you to ever come back, you should comp the whole meal, or at least offer a free dinner the next time around. I've used Yelp a bunch of times to check out restaurants ahead of time, but this meal inspired me to actually start up my own account.",0
28060,"I used to love XS but Saturday was ridiculous. We got a table for a bachelorette party and I guess since it's all inclusive (bottle of vodka, champagne, tax and grat for $600) we were totally ignored all night after being placed in Suburbia on the other side of the pool. We were supposed to have a host text us but none ever did so I had no one to call when we were stuck in the table line forever. My friend has a broken foot and was on crutches so I thought it was ridiculous that they walked the most busy and ass backward way when taking us to the table. He was on his phone the whole time and didn't even wait for my friend to keep us. Obviously I didn't tip him. When we got to our table, there was a used condom on the ground next to it and it took an hour and me asking 3 different people to get it cleaned up. Service was crappy and people kept sitting on the arms of our couch. Security was non-existant which is weird because on the inside and the tables outside but still near the inside part, service and security is great. There was a bunch of people on e, including our neighbors to the left, so that got annoying. Then, the club was so over capacity that they wouldn't even let us inside or near the floor until 3AM. They just locked us outside. This place has just been going downhill since Hakkasan opened, the acts, the crowd, everything just seems to be getting worse which is a shame because I used to really like XS (see past review). I'll just stick to other clubs for right now. I mean, even Marquee is better.",0
16574,"After hearing good things about this place, I finally made it here for lunch. Unfortunately, it was after the menu change so I was expecting different choices. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't much space to sit. There were maybe 5 small tables near the ordering counter and just as much at the patio. This was a fast casual place(you order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you). The menu was somewhat small. You get to pick between pizza, salad, or sandwich. I decided on a gyro and my bf got the corn pizza. Since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there. I was skeptical since all I could see was the kitchen and waitstaff in that area, but it turned out there was a ton of restaurant seating that you can't see when you go in. We weren't sure if we were suppose to sit there since it looked more formal, but we did anyway. The food came within a reasonable amount of time and it was decent. My gyro was generously portioned. The pickle that came with my gyro could have been more crisp and the tzatziki sauce was pretty bland. The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got. My main dislike of this place was the layout. Seating shouldn't be hidden in the back. The food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me. I'd describe this place as underwhelming. At least this place has underground parking.",1
35089,"Loved the ambiance, loved the music it wasn't too loud we could still carry a conversation. We came 5 girls for their monday night comped dinner + 1 drink, you just pay a tip of $15-20 each which of course is great. However most of the food were half cooked sliders w/ground beef and the salmon. It seems like everything was cooked in a rush. Not sure if it was because the dinner was comped but I wouldn't come back here again to pay full price for a meal.",1
41977,"We tried two dishes: Lomo a Caballo (beef strip saute) and Tallarin Saltado de Pollo (linguine with chicken). The best part of the beef plate was probably the fried plantains, which were savory and sweet at the same time. The gravy/drippings also had a good flavor, which spread into the rice, french fries, beef, and vegetables. A couple of the beef strips were raw and therefore could not be eaten safely, which makes me wary of the quality control in the kitchen. The chicken dish had better spices and a similarly good gravy for the noodles. However, the flavors in both dishes were subtle overall. They had a nice home-cooked feel, but didn't blow us away or give us a desire to visit again. There was a nice starter placed on the table, which consisted of some kind of hollow, dried corn pieces and two tzatziki-like dipping sauces (one mild, one spicy). This was an interesting and pleasant dish to try while we waited a very long time for our food. While the food was pretty good, the ambiance and service were not. The dining area was completely chaotic, with one assistant constantly running around moving tables and chairs... even our own after we had already been seated. There were tables noisily sliding around, chairs flying over my head, and my shoulders constantly being bumped by the two workers whizzing by in the cramped dining space. My other concern is the lack of cleanliness. The floors, tables, walls, etc. looked like they were not cleaned or maintained regularly, which is a health and sanitary concern. Ultimately, we waited about 15 minutes for anything to drink and nearly an hour for our food. The service was unacceptably disorganized and inefficient. I can't speak to how this food stacks up against other Peruvian cuisine. The dishes were pretty good, although I would like stronger spices and flavors. The environment and service were poor. Overall, these items make it very unlikely that I would visit again.",1

Good stuff to satisfy the hungry beast. I was disappointed they didn't have any lumpia shanghai though. Today I got the halo halo which was refreshing. Although it had more toppings -leche flan, ube & mango ice cream, and ube halaya? and bananas -than the surrounding eateries (Red Ribbon & Chow King), it seemed to lack more of the other stuff like the beans, coco gel, and more gulaman. I made it home and the bed of ice is what kept it alive until after a pancit and fish with rice dinner.

48611,"Come for the Mediterranean food, but not for the Mediterranean service. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly, however the time it took to get our orders in was quite a while. I had asked the waiter for a side of pita bread to go with my meal, but we did not see him for the rest of the night. Maybe he got lost in the kitchen where we frequently heard glasses being dropped. Our drink glasses were never refilled, and I had to ask for the bill, as we waited about 10 minutes after finishing without any sign of our waiter. Sad to say that such a wonderful meal could be spoiled by such terrible service. This place has a lot of potential, but definitely need to work on a couple things before they move up on my list.

21553,"I have eaten at Brokers a lot recently with my bf. He loves to go there on Sundays as they have a pretty good happy hour from 5-6:30. Cheap sushi (obviously) but also good drink specials including 3-4$ VERY LARGE bottles of beer, including some specialty brands. We are both avid sushi people and I would say the sushi is up there in terms of quality and taste, but maybe not the BEST in town. Tip: If you're trying to go there during happy hour (esp on Sundays) it is smart to just grab a seat at the bar if you don't mind grabbing a stool. Otherwise there's a very good chance you will wait for a table, and after you are seated, will have quite a wait for the food as well. - I'm not a big bar girl, but my bf always snags us a couple seats there and we are served pretty quickly...I would probably never even attempt to get a seat during a busy time because I really think this is when the service starts going out the window.",3
21438,"Omg!!! Why aren't you open longer?!!?!! I dream about Berry Blendz smoothies. So yummy... Love the omega fuel with granola on top. I use to work for JIU and we had the exact same thing, but there's no JIU in Vegas so I make my trip out to Berry Blendz from Henderson to satisfy my smoothie craving. For you health nut, try carrot/apple with yogurt and bananas (granola blended optional)... So good!!",4
5592,"I'm a fan of Fabulous Freddy's, but think this one is just okay. Compared to the one I frequent, this one isn't as busy at all. My usual Fabulous Freddy's takes a little longer for a car clean and wash, but at least the job is perfecto. Some Pros: -Close to one of my gyms. I can get me car washed or detailed while I shed some pounds. -Close to Rachel's Kitchen. I can get my eat on while they clean my car -Quick: One of the quicker car washes I've been to. The Freddy's I usually go to takes a long time for your car to get cleaned. I've even waited as much as 45 minutes for a regular detail. Here you get your car back with the quickness. Some Cons: -The detail wasn't as good as the other Fabulous Freddy's. Outside was fine, inside needed a little work. I was in a rush on my most recent visit so I finished what they didn't when I got home. -No real lobby. There's outside seating to wait for your ride and a makeshift lobby between the coolers and chips. Not much comfort inside in my opinion. I'm not saying I won't come back. I still think the job they do here is okay. But if I had a choice, I will continue to go to the Freddy's I usually hit right off Craig Rd.",2
35220,"NOBODY likes going to the Post Office and this location is the poster child as to why. Oh my God, this is the USPS from HELL! The employees are SO SLOW, the customers are even slower.

Good luck! Their response? \""We don't got no more, try another location.\"" This location does NOT process passport applications so don't waste your time.

41666,"When trying to decide on a great family place to eat I always choose Beef's! It is a great place for kids with a great kids menu! Also, the adult menu has such a huge selection that no matter who is in your party there will always be something for them to choose from and like! Then for happy hour..I like to get together with my girlfriends and meet for a drink after work on occasion. We choose beef's b/c of there drink specials and all the new drinks they have been adding! Plus, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. I think the prices are much better than neighboring venues. 5 stars from me!",4

6070,"After reading reviews both here and on other sites, we decided to try it. It was 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday. The whole dining experience began with them out of the Vietnamese appetizer I wanted to try. So I ordered 2 old stand-bys - wanton soup & an egg roll. My husband ordered steamed dumplings. Soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted. Egg roll was greasy, cold & tasteless. Only the hot mustard saved it. Dumplings were very good. Ordered chicken with cashew nuts. Not a single cashew. Veggies might have been waved over the wok - huge pieces of green pepper, celery (stalk cut into 1/3's), big chunks of carrots all so crunchy, I almost asked for a dip to go with them! Food very cold. When I complained there was not 1 nut on plate, he said they forgot to put them on top. He came back with a dish of warm cashews and put them on my entree. No sense in complaining about temp of food - I don't take any chances of irritating the chef/cook. While my husband liked what he ordered (can't remember - poh something with chicken), it also was cold. Only item that was hot was the complimentary tea. Best thing about this restaurant - our waiter was pleasant & polite - we tipped him the usual 20% we tip - it wasnt his fault. We absolutely love the food at Yummy's in the Rostraver/Belle Vernon area. We like to order take-out. We live 20 minutes from there and the food is piping hot when we get it home! We won't stray from there again. Sorry, Me Lyng - food was cold, tasteless & mine was lacking one of the titled ingredients. Never again.",1

46067,"Decided to hit up Cowbell for a late Saturday night dinner date with the hubby. Since we got there around 9:00, we didn't have to wait at all for a table. We were seated immediately and had a server at our table very quickly after that. We ordered the deviled eggs w/bacon as an appetizer & it was delicious! I ordered the Boogan's Bacon burger for dinner w/sweet potato tots as my side. The tots were amazing, if you like sweet potatoes, I highly recommend trying these! Even though it tasted excellent, I was extremely disappointed at the size of my burger. The onion roll was a generous size but the patty underneath was more the size of a slider than an actual burger. Aside from that one negative we had a very enjoyable dining experience & will definitely go back. There's several other items on their menu that look like must try's! Cowbell has a funky modern decor and although it can be a bit loud inside, it has a really cool atmosphere.",3
37038,"The first time we tried the restaurant was on a Saturday at lunch and the patio hadn't been cleaned from Friday night with dishes still on the tables. The happy hour beer selection is excellent and the pizza is pretty good but unfortunately, they failed our number one bar food test, the nacho test! Their nachos are quite possibly the worst we've ever had. Don't be fooled by the 'queso' description on the menu, the queso is simply a small lump of slightly warmed cheese sauce plunked on top of a bowl of cold dry chips and completely flavorless ground beef. Lastly, we are big fans of eating outdoors this time of year and but unfortunately, the small patio is used as the smoking section for the restaurant so it is thick with cigarette smoke making it a nasty experience. Because the servers are always pleasant and the happy hour beer prices are good we may be back for a beer, but it won't be the local dinner spot we'd hoped it would be.",2
14437,"Beautiful place but terrible service. Terrible food!!!! Atmosphere was middle age white couples. We were a group of people from different ethnicities and were pretty much out of place. Not good for big groups. They are not accommodating at all! For such a pricey place you would think the food would be good. It was so bad and does not even taste fresh! Very disappointed, would not come back!",0
13477,"Sadly, I have to put in a negative for my most recent experience at my favorite bar in Old Town. I was excited to share my favorite hang out with my cousins in from Illinois, for dinner before St. Patrick's Day festivities. The bouncer said he could not let any more patrons in since they didn't have enough staff to cover all the tables. Half of the tables were EMPTY!!! The manager came out and said they were short staffed, some people didn't come in and we would have to wait about 30 minutes, or until enough people left. I can certainly understand the predicament, however this manager was unapologetic. I convinced my cousins to come back later for a night cap and some appetizers, and the same manager delivered our food and said, \""I see you cam back!\"" Again, no apology for the situation, and didn't even offer a free drink or appetizer for our inconvenience. I love this place, and will come back based on my past experiences, but the manager needs serious customer experience training, because my cousins said they will never go back based on this bad experience.",1
8303,"I was in Phoenix for business, traveling alone, and based on the reviews decided to go to Lon's for dinner. I wanted a nice outdoor seating environment. While I enjoyed my dining experience, there were several factors that prevented Lon's from being a five-star dinner in my book. If you are traveling on business, or eating with work colleagues, I would not recommend Lon's. On the night that I ate there, it appeared to be predominately patronized by retirees. It was a leisurely crowd, as opposed to a more urban, more serious crowd. This is not to say that the customers were not enjoying their meals, but if you are a business traveler in a suit or eating alone, you would definitely feel out of place at Lon's amongst those 60-and-70-somethings meeting friends for a long dinner. I also had the impression that it was the type of place you might go for an anniversary, or special birthday. There was a large group of 8 people celebrating a family occasion. It lacked the seriousness of the types of places i like to go to when I travel for business. That's not the restaurant's fault at all, but prospective customers should be aware of the target market at Lon's. What the restaurant is responsible for is overcooking my rack of lamb, which at a surprise $68, ought to have been cooked perfectly and included a bit more on the plate. The price on the menu indicated \""market price\"" but I would never have guessed at the actual price. I really should have returned the lamb, but was trying to enjoy my evening and didn't want to make a big deal out of something that was totally edible and for which I would be submitting my receipt for reimbursement. Nevertheless, i was just not impressed with the quality of the food for the price. My waiter was very good, although was FAR more attentive to the tables with four people than he was even to the tables with two people. He chatted up the four-toppers, while leaving us two-toppers and singles to linger. The outdoor dining patio was very nice, although it was quite dark. While I am only 36 years old, I had a great deal of difficulty seeing the details of my meal while I was eating it, and the waiter actually used a flashlight to illuminate it as it was being served to me so that I could \""see what I paid for.\"" Overall, Lon's was very nice, but the kind of place I would take my mom for mother's day or her birthday. I won't go back for a business dinner, and probably won't go back when I am in town again in a few weeks. I just didn't connect with it. Lon's had every opportunity to make me a \""raving fan\"" of it's food, service, and atmosphere, and it failed to do so despite its positive attributes.",2
12923,"Lovely place. Dim, romantic setting, heavy linens and silverware, polite and prompt service. I gave it \""spendy\"" with three $$$ because everything I REALLY wanted to eat there was in that category - you could get away with less, but once you've sat down with their warm baguette and a glass of wine, you won't want to. The escargots were terrific but one was very sandy/gritty, I was concerned about my teeth. Excellent hangar steak and of course the steak frites were amazing. With so much variety in Vegas, it's tempting to move on to another restaurant and another and another, but this one is definitely a keeper, will go again next time we're in town, regardless of the other temptations. Not sure if you consider this dressy or casual, both would apply here - you do need a shirt with sleeves, no wifebeaters. But golf shirts and shorts are fine. 4 stars for service, ambiance and the dinner I had, wish I could tell you folks about more of the food there but will review it again next time I'm in Vegas.",3
20430,"Great for serious BBQ cookers. No better place to get supplies. If they don't have it that can usually get it.

There is no other place to stock up on BBQ product in Vegas.",4
46929,"Not so sure what all the hype is about in the reviews here. My take on Tennessee Grill is sub par. Wife had the Ruben which was average at best. She had the onion rings an again average at best. As for myself I read the reviews on the pulled pork on a pretzel bun an that seemed liked like a sure thing. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. The bun an pork was ok but the sweet BBQ sauce was quite possibly the worst I've tasted. It did come with A spicy BBQ that was better flavor wise however it was way too spicy to enjoy. I ended up eating the sandwich with store bought BBQ sauce from the fridge. BTW the pulled pork across the highway at Q2U BBQ is in a whole different league. If you haven't tried it you need to!! I had it with sweet potato fries that were over cooked. We also got a side of potato salad. I read someone's review that the potatoes were not cooked all the way but didn't think that would happen again an to my surprise they were 1/2 cooked an 1/2 uncooked. Not sure how this happens in one batch when all were cut about the same size. Flavor was good but 1/2 cooked potatoes isn't very appealing. The thing the really drops this establishment down for me is the very small portion sizes, for the prices they're charging I expected better food quality an larger portions. I personally think the over achieving reviews stem from the very poor food the restaurants in Anthem out out so this actually may seem good in comparison but for myself I for sure will not be returning for lunch or dinner. I'd like to try breakfast but in afraid id only be more disappointed.",1
47874,"Wow! Such great customer service. I live all the way in Hawaii and even with the distance, time zone difference, and my procrastination I was able to get flowers delivered to my boyfriends mother bright and early on Mothers Day by just calling a day ahead right before they closed! She keeps talking about how beautiful they are and sent me a picture of them. I couldn't be happier- thanks guys!",4
46583,"I had a terrible experience with Todd and Vision Collision. My car was vandalized so I looked for a local repair shop to give business to and found them on Craigslist. Pics of the work looked great so I decided to head down to see what they could do. Todd was about to close up shop but looked over my car seeing that 8 panels would need to be repaired and repainted. I told him it had a dent in the one door that would need to be removed along with dings along the body line, since all 4 doors, fenders and quarters needed to be fixed and repainted. I wanted the whole car repainted since 8 panels had to be done anyway and I believed we had agreed upon that. I also asked for him to work with me on my deductible and he said no problem with that or doing the work. It was all yes-yes and no problem. I signed the paperwork and now it was up to him and the insurance company. I get a call saying the car is being sanded and prepped at the moment and it gets brought up about the 8 panels being repainted and not the whole care. I am a bit taken back by this because I thought we agreed on doing the whole car but chalk it up as miscommunication. If it was not already being worked on I would have picked my car up from them and took it somewhere else. I get a call to pick up my car, he has had it for a week and half so plenty of time to do a great job right? WRONG! I get there and all the door dings are still there, the key mark on the one fender is still visible, paint hazing on the one door and the other fender. I point these things out and he says I have a good eye, no shit I wanted my car right and you were paid $2000 from my insurance company for shoddy work. Basically my car was not repaired to my satisfaction nor to what was written on the estimate for the insurance company and way less what we agreed upon. He did fix the dent on the one door but the door dings are still there along with a key mark on the fender. The body guy must not have a good eye at all missing all of that and to not repair each panel and get rid of some small dings chalking it up that it is more labor cost for you when I 100% certainly pointed out the dings specifically saying they needed to be fixed and they were not. Regardless of it all the work was not done to my satisfaction and damage was painted over. You can buff out the hazing certainly but you cannot buff out painting over a chip in the paint which should have been sanded down properly nor the key mark which was painted over. I recommend you get it in writing if you make an agreement with Todd or record the conversation because he will over promise and under deliver. He did some of what he wrote up on the estimate but clearly could see I was unhappy. Word of mouth and reviews like these make and break businesses. I will do a HD video walk around and post the link showing the issues I had from my car that was picked up just a few days ago. Totally unacceptable for getting $2000 to repaint 8 panels and not repair them properly, I could have went to nearly any shop and they would have got the handful of dings out and repainted the car for that kind of money. Then telling me its a 14 year old car and not sure what I am expecting. Regardless of the vehicle the work should be done right, my car is a 2 ton business card with over spray on the trim and windows still too! When I worked in my fathers shop we went the distance and would never repaint and panel and leave door dings in it or key marks. A couple extra hours of time to make it right because it represents us when it leaves the shop and getting all the over spray off trim and windows because it is not the customers problem to deal with nor hazing of the paint which you can see across the parking lot. Good eye he says, I say open your damn eyes! Stay away from this business, you could go to Maaco and they will happily paint over damaged panels. Vision does not go the extra mile or the miles they agree to and are paid well for.",0

7644,Beware of Stress-O-Pedic mattresses! Furniture Plus has great prices on mattresses...or so I thought. 2 years ago I bought a queen SOP Posture Correct mattress because it was so comfortable in the store. They delivered it and set it up...wonderful. One problem. This thing had such a strong odor I had to take it outside and let it air out for almost a year! Stress O Pedic uses poly urethane foam which has some horrible properties. Number one...toxic fumes. Two...highly flammable. Three..they hose the mattresses down at the factory with flame retardant chemicals that are known carcinogens. I tried to return the mattress but got screamed at by the sales person over the phone. So dont expect there to be any warranty. I had to use a plastic mattress protector to keep the fumes from killing me. We need to wake up and check what our mattresses are made of. Many of our pains and health problems come from sleeping on a toxic mattress. Buyer beware.,1

Prices for pool during promo hours are great.",2
384,"The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget. You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys. Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon. I brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours. Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800. I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere. It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon. They assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done. I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more.",1
10119,"We were in Las Vegas one week ago, We purchased a one day ticket for $12 each because we were wanting to get from the Wynn area down to the Luxor to pickup tickets for the show that night. We had to walk from the Wynn down to the nearest station (that we were told was) at the Imperial Place......OMG what a long walk in 113 degree temperature. Then the walk through the casino to get to the station. We just missed the monorail so had to wait for the next one.....the platform is hot! The monorail itself is beautiful, smooth, fast....perfect. We got off at MGM (the last stop) and walked and walked and walked again. After picking up our tickets we wanted to go back to the Wynn for the afternoon and decided to take a taxi instead of the monorail. The taxi driver explained that the original idea was to put the monorail right down the middle of the strip but the taxi and shuttle services complained....therefore it ended up behind the hotels. Really that is too bad because we will never use it again and it seems like it is a huge waste of money.",1

32067,"Julian Serrano, where have you been all my life? Recently had a ladies weekend in Vegas and a friend made reservations at this amazing restaurant in the Aria. We were all starving after a day at the spa and begged the waiter to bring plates out as they were ready. They were bringing plates out in what felt like seconds. And everything was amazing, but the highlights for me were the coca vegetarian, the stuffed piquillo peppers, and the churros. (Good number of items for vegetarians, by the way.) My mouth is watering now. Back to Vegas. Must go back to Vegas.",4

First, the people who work here are really nice and helpful--their critiques are never harsh but always suggestive and kind. Second, they never tried to upsell me. They asked my price, I gave it and they brought piles of jeans at or below the price and never once pushed me to go for a more expensive pair. Third, I was a little apprehensive that overstock might equal low-quality but they have a solid range of brands, similar to Nordstrom Rack in the US. On top of it I came with my 9-month old son and some stores aren't that down with the babies (i understand why), but not these guys, the whole staff was phenomenal with him and did not try to rush me out.",4

I had the 3 veggies plate with mac & cheese, collard greens, and cream squash. I also had a few bites of the fried pickles. Fried pickles were good. Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable. Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that. Cream squash was OMG kinda not good. It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup. Waitress wasn't too friendly at all. I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on! Seriously, I'm getting tired of all the hypes floating around town about these hip new places. So far I've been disappointed by most of them.",1
32852,"You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go. My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were \""normal\"" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. *I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant.

27080,"Who would have thought that you could get a world class brilliantly conjured vegetarian restaurant in the middle of Edinburgh! The starters were definitely the best part about the menu. The caramelised onio tartlet with smoked cheese and slow dried tomato was delicious. The ravioli parcel was sublime with an elegantly blended mix of artichoke and chickpeas. The mains were very moderately priced between \u00a310-12 (moderate wrt London restaurant pricing). We tried the red pepper risotto, stir fried vegetables with udon noodles and smoked tofu and the Mushroom strudel with mash and Mediterranean vegetables. Everything was very flavourful, especially given that it was all vegetarian cooking. We skipped dessert, and short of came back another time to try the remaining items on the menu. Highly recommended for vegetarians. The idea behind going to David Bann, especially for me who can't finish a meal without animal protein, was to take a set of elderly vegetarian Indians, a rather tough audience because of their seasoned and stubborn taste buds; and they loved everything on their plate. The super friendly service (they did take some time to get us our food though), along with a tastefully modern decor gave us something of a warm welcome in Edinburgh.",3
33785,"Is there a way to put a negative star. This place deserves it. It was the first apartment I moved in to post parents. Cheap and all I really needed. I stayed in my one bedroom for 3 or 4 months. I actually like the one bedroom best but it still wasn't great. It's in a bad neighborhood. I stayed in the inside near the playground so I always heard kid yelling and screaming. Eventually I got a 3 bedroom with my friends and moved right upstairs from where I was. Worst apartment I have EVER HAD! When we first moved in there there were multiple problems. The worst was the bugs. I hate bugs. They were everywhere and it was disgusting. I eventually had to walk down to the office and ask to speak with the manager personally. She then talk to me and it took weeks to find out what the problem was. Ugh! Worst part was leaving.. I got charged sooooo much for all kinds of crap. They didn't make me aware of my early leaving. Over $1800. I couldn't believe it, worse they didn't send it to me so it went to collection.",0
40005,"For such a small restaurant, Root 174 has a rather large reputation. With enough tables to seat no more than twenty people or so, you walk into pedestrian decor, pizza parlor tables, and a very bland-appearing bar. The bar is stocked with the classic cookbooks, such as Modernist Cuisine and Julia Childs. I had a good laugh thinking of the chefs, flipping through the books preparing the dish. It'd be akin to surgeons flipping through an anatomy book in the OR! The menu is seasonal - so my selections may not be relevant in the future, but the food was excellent. If the crispy brussel sprouts remain on for apps, it's a must-get. They are crunchy, savory with bacon, and sweet with some honey(?), The plate was gone in sixty seconds. My counterpart did not want to venture into the land of bone marrow creme brulee, and we got the wedge salad - which was really good. I'm not a big fan of salads as appetizers, but c'est la vie. Entrees were a duck sausage with gnocchi and some ricotta. The duck sausage was flat-out awesome. The gnocchi was easily the best I've ever had. I've heard the Top Chef critics describe perfect gnocchi as \""pillowy\"" before, and now I know what they mean. The gnocchi might as well have floated in my mouth. The entire dish was a hit. The pork belly was equally fantastic - although I would recommend that you get it as an appetizer for 4. It's so flavorful and rich, four pieces may be too much for an entree. Some of the sides, like a pickled relish, tend to get lost in the dish as well. But, man, I am craving that pork belly right now. Desert was a Nutella bread pudding, and a bit of a letdown. The bread pudding was definitely average, and tasted more like stale french toast. The raisins, nuts, and nutella, did bring some joy to the dish, but it paled in comparison with the apps and entrees. Root 174 is a very casual environment, and certainly a foodies' delight. It's a great find and well worth the trip.",3

Maybe it's because I'm spoiled after having pizza as delicious as Joe's NY Pizza in Old Town, but this pizza is a big yawn. The venue is great. They just need a new recipie for pizza.",0

Because when you define \""Air\"" as a smoker's patio and \""Earth\"" as weird alien shit on the walls and \""Fire\"" as the burning of your ear drums and \""Water\"" as a place to buy really expensive drinks that dehydrate you, I just can't really comprehend how our $30k millionaire ballers can afford to keep this place going, even in an economic environment that protects only their class. But that's why I'm a $20k impoverished sycophantic parasite on our society. No business sense. Two stars for the money they put into this place in the first place. And the elevator to the private VIP bullshit area. Classy. Retarded classiness.",1
5487,"This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious. They don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!",3
41305,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.",0
30604,"Just like Homer Simpson, I am a big fan of the donuts. Doooooooooonnnnnuuuuuttttssssss. This Dunkin is conveniently located near my office at the corner of South and Tyvola, and although it can be a bit of a pain to get in and out of, you have several choices for entry/exit that you can choose from so you can be on your way with your sugar goodness quickly. This location also has a drive-thru which makes it super easy to grab a sack of munchkins with a cup o' joe and be on your way. DD has great coffee... either hot, cold or blended - always tasty and a great perk for the morning or day. I have come through and gotten donuts, munchkins, muffins and bagels and have always had fresh items. I have also had their breakfast sandwiches and they are quite good as well. Great selection of many different items and flavors.",3
47729,"So I had Pita Pit tonight for dinner and it was so-so. Its definitely a subway-esque fast food joint. I got the chicken souvlaki and was really disappointed by the quality of the chicken, it very spongy and some pieces seemed discolored. The vegetables tasted fresh though and the pita itself was good I just couldn't stomach that meat. If for some reason I find myself back at Pita Pit I'd definitely go the veggie route.",2
40478,"Honestly, one of the best meals of my life. In some ways I don't want to be so honest in this review. It still seems like a hidden away secret and I know next time I'm in Vegas I won't be able to get same day reservations and the prices may increase to reflect how amazing this food really is. Our cab driver did not know of this place at all. It is Far end North strip (think past Encore near Circus Circus area and just off the strip in a quietish looking hotel. The restaurant has a good atmosphere not haughty, but classy and comfortable. Our waiter was excellent. I had the heirloom tomato appetizer, filet mignon, and cheesecake while my husband had the Ahi, all amazing really truly. You won't regret going here! We found it through reviews here and on tripadvisor",4
46055,"Reading the previous review, I am very surprised with their experience at Bink's. I too dined at this great new restaurant last night and experienced the five star service I expect from Chef Kevin Binkley and his staff. Keep in mind, this restaurant has only been open since Wednesday, March 20! My friend and I were 15 minutes late for our reservation and still were seated promptly, first on the patio and then when we decided it was a bit too cold they told us we could wait a bit for a table or sit at the bar. We happily sat at the bar where we enjoyed the bartender, Joby as well as the sommelier, Amy Binkley's service. After a great wine recommendation, we ordered the beets and the burratta. Both were served in approx. 5 minutes after we ordered. And both were so tasty! We also received a little gift from the Chef, an order of sweet and sour sweetbreads, which were delicious! And not something I would usually order so it was a great treat. Next we asked for help choosing between the cauliflower and the broccoli. Joby said to go with the broccoli and he was spot on! Finally, we ordered the risotto and it was the best part of our meal. We wanted seconds, but opted to try a cake doughnut (just one!) before we finished up, paid our tab and headed home. The bill for all of that food and a bottle of wine, only $80!!! My review of this restaurant - incredible food, polite, accommodating service, overall wonderful experience. I will be back! In fact, I already made another reservation for next Saturday!",4
39029,"I recommend that you try Table but you will have to have some patience. There is a lot to like about it, and I have my fingers crossed for this restaurant that definately has the right idea: local foods and delicious. I see from other reviews that consistency may be an issue. I will keep going back to Table because it has so much potential but it isnt yet on my regular haunt list I hope that changes soon, You can tell a lot of thought goes into the menu and it seems Chef driven, but sadly service has been mediocre and in my opinion not on par with with the food. They use local food (yeah!) and I have had some really REALLY excellent food here, hence the four stars. I have tried many of the appetizers and small plates for lighter dinners and they were terrific. Also I have had some great salads, and a burger that was absolutely perfect. A roasted pork chop was as good as it could be, and also loved some gnocchi in browned butter. Yum. But it always seems to fall just short because it lacks in service and attention. I havn't had any awful service, but it is definitely way below where it should be for the caliber of food. Average at best. I hadn't been in a while, and went the other night. I found the menu had been redone to add a lot more affordable items, and it seems to have picked up business a bit and service also better. As business gets better hopefully they can attract better servers and stay consistent. But the food was great.",3
15182,"This place was pretty nice (not super fancy but decorated nicely) but the food was average. We came here bc someone had \""the best\"" beef noodle soup here over a year ago and loved it. Unfortunately, they did not like it this time, stating it was somewhat flavorless. Food here is definitely overpriced, as I learned many restaurants in the nice casinos are, but we were comped so I can't complain about price. However, had I had to pay for this meal, I would not have been happy. I got the Hainan Chicken Rice, which was really dry. Usually, the rice is simmered in broth, but the rice was pretty dry - chicken, too. We also got the Beef Chow fun, which wasn't bad but not excellent either. The best part of my meal was the Iced Coffee (which I think they charge $6 for). Everyone also liked the Fried Shrimp Balls, which came on a dim sum cart. I was excited to see Soupy Dumplings on the cart, but alas, they were only moist and not very soupy at all. Most items were mediocre and I most likely will not eating here again.",2
39263,"I ordered a draft IPA and a whiskey coke and paid 7 bucks plus tip. Coming from Chicago, I actually was momentarily confused at how cheap that was. It was a short wait to get on a pool table. The dart machine was a little annoying to deal with whilst drinking, but I suppose most unfamiliar game consoles would be after having a few. A lot of TVs for watching the game are available but after 10 PM on a Saturday they definitely go unnoticed. We played $5 worth of country songs on the jukebox ... I couldn't tell if the clientele thought of this as awesome or terrible, but I was having an awesome enough time to not really care. They at least sang along with Red Solo Cup, so I'll take that as a good sign. Only problem is that based on location you definitely need a DD or a cab on call. Plenty of parking for that DD though.",3
22257,"I was craving fruit for breakfast, so when my boyfriend pulls up at a Mexican restaurant, I was a little skeptical. I was wrong! Fully admitting this. The big fruit platter with honey was so fresh and perfect. I had a mango juice that was literally pureed mango. Amazing. Boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros. Also mui bueno. I guess this joint was on Food Network for their gigantic burger. Man v.s Food.... That guy. So, funny thing is, his face is plastered all over the restaurant, including on the servers shirts!! It's cool that he could give them the spotlight they deserve!",3
46101,"I go to this market just about every week during on-season. They are the best market in the Madison area. Large enough to have a great variety of things, pretty much everything you'd expect at a market, and small enough that it can be a quick trip instead of an hour-long venture just to find what you want. They always have some sort of performer doing music, which ranges from \""not my taste\"" to wonderful. Shout-outs to Noel's Jams & Jellies, for having the best homemade jams, jellies, pickles, sauerkraut & more that I've ever had. You really can't go wrong. Also, Cafe Social has some great iced beverages. Also, Farmer John has the best cheese curds in WI, as far as I'm concerned.",3
19934,"08/02/2013 We were picked up at Mandalay Bay to go to Caesars for dinner, we were dressed up I had a suit on the wife a cocktail dress and Diamond necklace. The driver took a call and started telling the caller, \"" for an Asian girl $250, for a Japanese girl $200, and went on for 5 minutes on the phone, when he got off the phone he tried to explain, all the drivers have pictures of the girls, I was astonished, I made note of the license & cab number, the driver said $9.00, I gave him $9.00 his eyes got wide and angry and he had the guts to say \""and no tip?\"" I told him my wife was deeply offended by your conduct and frankly, so was I, he said no problem and drove off. I tried to call Wittlesea, couldn't get anyone, I did call the cab authority. Thanks for starting our night out on a horrible note! I was not thrilled!",0
45105,"As a fan of Gordon Ramsay, to me this place does live up to the hype! You can say this place was built for tourists and conventioneers, but damnit, it is good! After seeing BurGR featured on Master Chef in a challenge, I was keen on checking this place out on my next visit to Las Vegas. My gf and I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon to a short line up. We took a gander at the amazing flaming signage of BurGR inside Planet Hollywood. Within 10 minutes, we were promptly seated. Our server Brandon was very welcoming and friendly, making us feel at ease. Throughout the lunch service, he regularly checked in on us and made sure our waters were refilled. He also recommended a great beer pairing with my burger. Since my gf loves ice tea (the kind you get in Canada), Brandon was aware that Las Vegas didn't have it so he had the bar made up something similar that more than met her standards for a great lemony iced tea, which made her very happy! I had the Farm burger while she had the Euro burger. Cooked to medium rare, the burgers were juicy and melt in your mouth. Balanced perfectly, my Farm burger's duck bacon and fried egg, more than complimented the flavors of the juicy beef patty. The Euro burger according to her could have used a little less blue cheese, but nevertheless she thought it was amazing still with arugula! The burger buns were fluffy and crisp, as were the fantastic truffle fries, whose portions were more than enough to share for two persons!

26513,"The W is definitely one of the more 'hip' hotels in Old Town, if you are looking for a more lively vibe, as opposed to relaxing, this is probably where you should stay. I have to say all staff I have ever encountered here from the valet guys, to the bartenders, servers etc have always been outstanding. The rooms are nice and modern and they serve their customers needs around the clock. It is within walking distance to Old Town nightlife and shopping at the boutiques, galleries and Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. I am a big fan of Sushi Roku, the restaurant attached to the W. I have always had great service, food and cocktails there. With this prime location you are also within a rock throw of many other fine dining establishments, cute local cafes and bars. The pool parties in the summer are rocking with DJs spinning tunes, and Scottsdale's finest (or as some call them Snotsdale's finest) prancing around 95% naked, and possibly 10% filled with plastic. At night this same pool area transforms itself into an energized nightlife spot. My last visit to the W I stopped in on a random Sunday evening to grab a cocktail with a friend and I was impressed. There were a quite a few patrons enjoying their Sunday Fundays and the bartender made sure to keep the vibe going. It was some of the best people watching I have done in a while... The lobby bar had cool lounge music vibing in the background. There were some hotel patrons with some escort-ish looking guests, which entertained us while time with our cocktails passed. I end up here on rather impromptu occassions, but every time has never been a disappointment.",3
28706,A great place to go for a game. Go for dinner. Or go on Saturday night and have fun with Tino's karaoke. The staff is always friendly ( Allison is our favorite). The food reminds me of the neighborhood places in Chicago. GREAT and plentiful. Helen and Cary make a drink that lets you know they want you to come back. And it's fun to see the Chicago sports memorabilia. And old Pictures from home. Like the newspaper from the Blizzard of 67. I always make sure to bring visitors to Jimmy's for a good time with great people. From the staff to the patrons. You always feel welcome at Jimmy's of Chicago.,4
17700,"CK's, why did it take so long for me to write a review on you? Perhaps I have taken your awesomeness for granted. I am always critical of neighborhood bars. Read my reviews, I'm critical of everything. Believe it or not, I've even been called an asshole. The thing is, I really don't have anything bad to say about this place. I hope the owner/manager reads this because the only way a local bar survives is with repeat business, and you sir and/or madam, have earned mine. I will now use my college education to cite with examples: Here is one thing you are kicking ass and taking names at Dirty Harry style. (did I fire five chicken wings or six? In all the confusion, I have kind of lost track myself) Daily specials. Not only are they awesome, they never change. Nothing pisses me of more than expecting something, driving down, and it is different. I have been coming in for quite a while on Tuesday nights with one of my friends. We always order the same thing (by the way, 40 cent wings on Tuesday and HUGE beer for $2.50...bring that shit on) That leads me to your servers. Usually, we are lucky enough to have the same one, and she is frigging awesome. Knows our regular order, walks up, takes the menu's away, jokes and says \""I know what your order is!\"" and brings it. (extra buck or two on the tip just for that) Even if we have another server, they are always polite, attentive, and friendly. Not coming up every 5 minutes bothering me or being non-existent. Seems like they wait until you are 75 percent done with your drink and THEN ask if you want more. Perfect. They attack with military precision few possess. Longest I think I have probably ever waited for my wings was 10 minutes. Maybe. Had a family birthday party here a few months ago on a weekend night and they made things VERY easy and everything was organized. Still on the subject of the servers, seems like there is virtually no turn over here and the wait staff seems like they actually enjoy their jobs, not like my job and unlike some other bars where the employees are bitchy and seem like they would rather stab you in the throat than take your order. CK's does not possess the bitchiness and violent tendencies as previously described. Other good points condensed in cliff note form: -Bands 3 nights a week with no cover. Awesome. -The video games actually work. Nothing pisses me off more than cramming a few dollars into playing big buck hunter and the fucking gun is broken. Or golden tee and the goddamn wheel is lopsided. The \""claw machine\"" actually has prizes you can win that are big enough for my dogs to at least have more than 5 minutes tearing up before I have to take it away. -pool tables aren't crooked or ripped up felt. All required balls are present and accounted for (it is amazing how many bars think two or three balls missing is acceptable) -Bathroom is free of the typical \""lake of piss\"" found under urinals or the crapper. Also very little graffiti on the stalls. -I don't think I have ever seen a dirty table here longer than 60 seconds. Nicholas Cage can't even steal a car that fast. -Patrons here seems to have a much lower douche bag ratio than most neighborhood bars. Still there, just lower. -They serve Pabst cheap (honestly I can't drink that ghetto piss but my Dad loves it and that is why he comes here) -They have that awesome trivia shit on the TV's. Bad points about this place: ..............I'll edit this if I ever come across any. Until then, this section stays blank. Keep up the good work!",4
8014,"I have to tell you that it pains me to give the restaurant by this name such a crappy review rating. I have been to two others of these in southern California and they are both 5*s in my book (and everyone I go there with every time I go down to visit). So, maybe I had high expectations. But no, I think they truly earned a 2. They may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me. First impressions are SO important. We went on Friday morning pretty much during peak breakfast time for most that do not get up at the crack of dawn. It was about 930am. We fully expected a wait for breakfast and as we suspected we had one. The young man functioning as host had a rather unique method. He did not write anyones names down, he just tried to remember who was who and in what order, even as people filed in. I guess it seemed to work ok as we did not hear any fights and got seated in a timely fashion. (Thank goodness for being a party of two and being able to sit at a little table.) I knew ahead of time what I wanted to order, though I was concerned that it would be too huge for me, would take a long time to cook, and my leftovers would have to sit in the car all day. I ALWAYS order the apple pancakes. They are my favorite. I just love them. Even if they take 30-45 minutes to bake and are humungous. Imagine sauteed apples with a pancake/cake batter poured on it with lots of cinnamon, baked in the oven. Yes, its sooo good. Usually. I was quite happy to see that they had a option of a Junior apple pancake, smaller version of the same goodness I usually like. They should all do this. SG ordered a regular egg dish, which also comes with some pancakes. After about 45 minutes, my pancake arrives. BURNT! So, if I had gotten it about 5 minutes earlier, it would have been perfect? Ironic. I thought it would be ok, but I could not eat the charred edges, they just were too burnt. Steve's meal took another 5 minute to come. My meal is the one that takes forever and then its like they forget the other order. I noticed this at the neighboring table and blew it off until it happened to us. They need to time things better. My food would have been cold if I was polite enough to wait. Our service was also pitiful. I had to get up and get the syrup from the bus station myself. Coffee refills were few and far between too. But, we were headed to a ball game, so we probably did not want to have too much coffee on board. I did notice the service at the neighboring tables with a different waitress appeared to be much better than ours, but I can only rate our experience. We will likely not be back here. There are lots of breakfast options elsewhere and I can save my Apple pancake as a treat for Socal.",1
22609,"I had a great lunch at Whole Foods today! I went looking for something they do not stock anymore :( and ended up eating a surprise lunch. I had an \""ok\"" sandwich but my significant other had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was AMAZING. I probably could have eaten 3 of them! I was pleasantly surprised. It was good, fast, and not too expensive!",3
38795,"We had a great time at this delightful Japanese shoebox. Had reservations, got right in, reservations were at the bar. That being said, this is not a large place. This is not even a medium sized place. They have a few tiny table seating areas off of a main bar/kitchen area. It's all very nice. They yell something in Japanese(?) when you walk in and leave. Our waiter was courteous and had good recommendations. We had two different \""Shochu\"" drinks, I expect these are similar to the \""Soju\"" beverages we had at Soyo that were so delectable. The food was fresh and interesting. The veggie spring rolls were superb, The tempura was delightful and crisp, Garlic potatoes were excellent and I had a beefy sprouty dish that was spectacular. This is the first time I've had Japanese that wasn't Sushi (or burgers at Bachi), so please forgive my being unable to explain what it was, just know it was all very good. My wife and I really enjoyed being that close to the kitchen (1.5 feet overlooking) and got to see the care of how everything was made. We had food, drinks, alcoholic and non, and five Tapas for less than fifty bucks. I was impressed.",4
14314,Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!,3
14188,"You don't get to take chicken strips from the lunch menu, put them on a very average waffle and call it Chicken and Waffles!!!! Thesse were by far the worst Chicken and Waffles I've ever had. They weren't even good chicken strips. Please please please go find someone's grandmother's fried chicken recipe and start over again. You should immediately take these things off your menu. They were HORRIBLE!!!! Wow! Ok! Now that I've got that out of my system, The Grand Lux Cafe has always been a \""Go to\"" spot whenever we've stayed at the Venetian. It's the affordable dining establishment. Overall the food has always been pretty good and they're open 24 hours. I'm sure I'll stumble in again some time.......",1
29343,"We have been into see Dr. Alazard three time for my newborn and everything has been wonderful so far. The one thing I've noticed is that they take people in the order they arrive. I can see other patients appointment times, and even though they're after ours, they get called first. Guess it pays to get there early! The desk girls on the well side are super sweet, the one I talked to on the sick side was a bit short but she may have been busy. The nurse has read the scale wrong twice now for my sons weight, but it doesn't change his percentile so it's not a big deal. We love Dr. Alazard and will continue to see him for our appointments!",3
15215,"I would have given Kahunaville one star for the service; but I really liked my drink and food. I ordered the big Kahunaville drink that you see in the pictures with the smoke and everything. It was so good and I am still using the cup because it is very fun. I also liked my food; but that's because I love any kind of food that includes pasta let alone penne pasta! But it was like I had to satisfy our server when isn't it the other way around? The server seemed to hate us and everyone else they were serving. By the end of the service we finally got the server to smile once. Mission accomplished! When we first walked in we weren't sure we had arrived because there was an oxygen bar that took up 80% of the entry to the restaurant. When we finally got noticed, even though there were people right up front at the oxygen bar, we were sat at a table in the back of the restaurant next to the DJ booth at the end of an abandoned stage. HAHA!! This was the most awkward experience at Vegas for us. Do not order the Paradise Sampler if you are very hungry; it doesn't even satisfy one person. The pineapple top and dry ice-filled volcano vase are fillers to make the platter appear bountiful.",1
4103,The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice.,2
16499,"By far my favorite hotel in all of Las Vegas. Sure many other competitors come close, but the Signature always stands out in my mind when I'm in Las Vegas. Let's start with their rooms. You really do feel spoiled when you're here. My first time there, I somehow lucked out and got upgraded to a one bedroom suite so I had my own bedroom and living room, sweet! The rooms are really clean and fully loaded with amenities. I think they're the only hotel so far that has the flat screen coming out from the desk. Next the pools. Every tower has their own pool, very private and not con jested. You got to love the the giant lounge sofas, you could stay out there forever relaxing ahhh...Lastly, I think what makes this hotel reign above others is their outstanding commitment to excellent customer service. I would be walking down the lobbies to the next hotel and before I could even open the door, an attendant would rush to my side and open the door for me. I wouldn't even have seen them coming. They're also constantly wiping down and cleaning every bit of the hotel, especially the doors, which is nice, who knows what people do with their hands out in Vegas. One time a staff member had his hands full carrying luggage and still rushed to the door just to open it for me, and it wasn't like I was carrying anything where I couldn't open it myself. I thought to myself wow, above and beyond. They really bend over backwards here for you. Great hotel!",4
322,"Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth.",1
44127,"Peculiar Rabbit is quite Peculiar. The fare here is quite inventive. Especially love the sweet tea brined wings, sweet tea, and truffle fries. Not a fan of the deviled eggs. Have came a number of different times, although I would say the Customer Service has not always been the best here.",2
41120,I love pizza and have to say this place is awesome!! Worth the drive if you dont live close. It isnt your ordinary pizza place. The dough is amazing.....I have visited twice and both times have been very please with food and service. Only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is because it is cash only. There is an atm machine....but I personally like the convenience of using my debit card at POS. I will definitely be back. Cant wait to try the baked ziti!!,3
13409,"AVOID THIS TOURIST TRAP: high prices, poor service, mediocre food, boring menu. Save your money for the slot machines (and not at the Bellagio). On our way to Olive's, we asked some Bellagio workers for directions. One pointed us in the right direction. But, as we walked away, his coworker made an insulting wisecrack (unbelievably rude). The hostesses at Olives were friendly and helpful. The waiter, on the other hand, was simply indifferent. He offered helpful information only when directly questioned. At these prices, I expect more - professionalism. at the very least. What we got was some burned-out character, who only came alive when offering us desserts (and then, only half-heartedly.) At fine restaurants, I look for creativity in the menu, especially the appetizers. The menu completely lacked creativity - no interesting appetizers, no interesting entrees, not even an interesting soup. (Potato soup, really? Is this Luby's?) The central theme in the menu appeared to be food that can be cranked out relatively quickly in mass quantities (so they can hurry the customer out the door). We were disappointed with the entrees. The steak - terrible. The short ribs - poor. The chicken - mediocre. The branzini (fish) - okay (nothing to write home about). Again, at these prices, you expect fine cuisine. Instead, you get overpriced mediocre food. We all declined dessert. Nobody at the table seemed willing to throw good money after bad. Nor should you. As we left, other unlucky tourists stood outside, waiting to be seated. I wanted to warn them to stay away (but didn't want to make a scene). So, I'm warning you: stay away from Olives.",0
44456,"My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge. We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros. We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor. We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner. The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable. The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat. We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks. The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time. There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant. Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back.",0

38338,"I was really excited to visit La Cave but I wasn't impressed. I planned on having a party of 13 eat and drink there for my sister's bridal dinner and went back and forth with the manager regarding seating. She claimed if we wanted to sit on the patio we had to have a set menu, which would run us about $60 per person. Honestly, I don't have that type of money and if I did I wouldn't have spent it there. Also, where is the patio located in this place? The pictures online are very misleading. We talked to the manager and wanted a large table in the back and we were told that would be fine. We were put in the very front of the entrance in the middle of the room ( which was in between two bars). The thing that irritates me the most is we could have just shown up and probably got a better seat with having to go through all the hassle of reserving a table. The service was ok. There was one lady who was actually paying attention to our table and she wasn't even our waitress (I wish I could remember her name). On several occasions we asked for waters and the waitress said ok and never came back. In all honesty she knew because the party was over 10 people she had a guaranteed tip included. She was NOT worth the $91.00 tip. The food was ok. I wasn't wowed by anything. The waitress said everything would come out when it's ready and at different times. I've worked in a restaurant for 9 years and I'm sorry that's a load of crap. It's called knowing how long things take to make and timing when to ring things in. I'm also sure the waitress could walk over to the kitchen and let people know to bring everything out at the same time. There are hundreds of other places to eat and drink at in Vegas. Sadly, I will not be back.",1
4334,"Older hotel, but fairly clean. Just needs some TLC. Staff and security friendly, restaurants have good food. Service good. Games are decent and I didn't feel like my $60 spent on gaming went too fast. I enjoyed myself. I'd probably stay here again. Their $35/night is, of course, loaded up with resort fees, incidental fees, security fees, and taxes. The cost to stay here is only pennies lower than non-casino hotels. Just another piece of information.",2

11577,"Ya know, sometimes things just kinda fall into place. Following more than 4 hours enjoying many of the treasures at the Carnegie Museums I was very hopeful of finding a local spot where I could rest my sore feet and enjoy a late lunch. Thankfully I made one right hand turn and ended up at the Union Grill. The place filled the bill for me. I sat at the bar and was immediately assisted by Laura who remained friendly and helpful throughout my meal. I opted for the BBQ-style sandwich w/ cole slaw and fresh fruit ( I'm afraid the good Dr. has advised me to reduce my intake of waffle fries...ugh.). The order arrived quickly and well presented, The bun, fruit and tasty pickle were all fresh. While the hefty sandwich was a bit difficult to eat without decorating my shirt, it was very tasty and hot. At about $18 including tip, my lunch was an excellent value. Union Grill has a good selection of beer (I'm not a big $10/bottle wine guy), what appeared to be an efficient staff and a clean restroom. When combined with the tasty food and a location near the Carnegie Museums/Carnegie Mellon and Pitt, it's a place I'm recommending to any of my friends who might find themselves in the neighborhood. I hope you'll enjoy it as well.",3
44125,Went there for a friends birthday. Our waitress didn't understand that we wanted split checks and that everyone was sharing the birthday girls portion. Took like 30 minutes for us to get our tabs. The mussels were delish. Would highly recommend. Lobster Mac n cheese was disappointing. Would not recommend. Very disappointing. We went the for the amazing view but it rained so we had to sit inside and it's very noisy and difficult to converse. I think had the weather been better this place would be great for after work drinks.,1
8154,"Good: the eye candy is delicious, and the udon is decent. Neutral/Bad: pretty much everything else. I couldn't hear but maybe 20% of what my dinner companions were saying over the blaring music, even when they were sitting right next to me. Overabundance of loud, obnoxious Guidos and douchebags with the obligatory popped collars and fauxhawks. I'm a sushi n00b, but even I could tell the bland, limp things my companions ordered were not right - if it's supposed to be tuna, shouldn't it be at least marginally tuna-flavored? The green tea tastes like coarsely-ground tree bark and looks like antifreeze. Finally, being in Old Town, parking is non-existent unless you're willing to walk from one of the public lots. I'm not going back, not even on a bet. There's plenty of better sushi places in the Valley.",1
40904,"Yes...its very clean. And yes, they're friendly. HOWEVER....the electronic cigarette aka e-cigs, are a rip off. Getting a product that bad is the reason why many fail. First of all they put out a lot of vapor aka smoke but do NOT deliver in taste & FEEL. The greensmart or whatever it is...is like smoking a cigarette with holes in it. And worst of all...that brand does NOT offer different mg of nicotine! Unbelievable! And the one they have does not state how many mg are in it. The whole point to me is to work my way down to zero. And if not...I want to feel it! Full flavor. Yet when I called in advance, the guy said \""oh yeah, just come on in. We carry so many I can't name em all\"". That gteen smart thing was ONLY ONE! WHAT?! Thats lying...and that's not okay. BTW, if its helpful for any1 to know. ..they also do NOT carry ANY tobacco products. None. Their focus is evidently on the drug side of things...full of hookahs or whatrver those are called, lol. And a lot of other paraphernalia. So its basically a good store for potheads (& maybe synthetics...I didn't look around much). Just sayin",1
36098,"One star for food and one for their awesome bartender Emmanuel who redeemed the offensive service I got here. I've came here twice and both times Emmanuel was working the bar-so friendly and personable! He's just an all around nice guy, likes to make sure everyone's having a good time. If I could've taken the tip back from our waiter and given it to him, I would've. He gave us more service in the 8 minutes we were at the bar than our \""waiter\"" did in the 45 minutes we were at our table. I get it, not everyone likes their job every day. I don't like my job every single day! But when dealing with customers you pretend to like your job and don't make them feel like their presence is a burden. Our waiter didn't get that memo and his inattentiveness bordered on neglect. He came to our table three times, once to take our drink orders, food orders and then to bring the check. The way he asked if we wanted the check basically said \""I want you to leave now.\"" The busser came by more often than he did to see if we needed anything. This place isn't worth the time if you're coming from out of your way. If you choose to go for the simple fact that yard house is the cluster that it usually is, sit at the bar!",1
17118,Horrible place. Not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago. The service was horrific. Rude and impatient staff. Price is weird and they charge you for everything. Not recommended at all.,0
48320,"The food here is excellent. The service was friendly but grossly incompetent. My husband and I arrived and there was not a table available. After about 10 minutes several tables left and a table was cleaned and we were seated. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes with no menus. I went to the counter. There was a person standing there that did not acknowledge me until I asked for menus. I took the menus back to my table and we sat there for another 10 minutes waiting to place our order. At this point I was confused as to how I was supposed to order. I went to the counter again to ask if I was supposed to order there. A server came over to take our order. After our order was placed, I noticed that 2 tables that had come in after us were already eating. Our food arrived and was very good. The owner came out during our meal and checked to see if we were enjoying our food. The server never returned for drink refills. We finished eating our meals and sat there for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared and for our check. The restaurant had slowed down considerably from the time of our arrival. There were two servers standing around chatting and one playing on her cellphone. I went to the counter again and asked for the check. The girl playing with her cellphone says she can close out my check and then proceeds to ask me for each item that has been ordered. It is a shame that we were not given even basic service. The food really was good, but we will not be returning.",2
21874,"Excellent service, great prices and their food is awesome. My wife and I ordered some onion rings, they showed up hot, plentiful and delicious (and cheap - $5). I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with chipotle mayo and cole slaw (but I'm allergic to carrots). The waitress told me the cook would make up a batch just for me that had no carrot and the whole thing was AWESOME. It showed up with fries and a pickle and I was very happy. It wasn't terribly busy and it's right on the strip in front of Monte Carlo. I can't wait to go back.",3
26571,"After being curious about Brazilian waxes for years, but always too scared to actually make an appointment, my good friend found Salon D'Shayn and recommended that I go to Courtenay to have my Brazilian wax virginity taken. I am SO GLAD I finally mustered up the courage to book an appointment because I am forever changed. Not only is Courtenay super professional and fun, but the wax experience was almost painless! Not at all what I was expecting, but in the best way possible. She makes you feel super comfortable the whole time and will even sing you some Frank Sinatra while she works her magic on your nether regions. :) I highly recommend Salon D'Shayn - the salon is funky, fun, and everyone makes you feel welcome. Plus with 50% off waxes for first time clients, you can't go wrong! Book an appointment with Courtenay, you won't be disappointed.",4
5088,"Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, take a chinese friend with you who knows how to order cuz the experience will b 10,000 times better.",3
20930,Price update. Sandwiches are now $3.25 they went up .25 Very peculiar experience today at Dakao. Ordered a veggie sandwich and was told not available but all other sandwiches have the same veggies. Place is still dirty and has a peculiar smell. not from baking bread either,2
31004,"Not a good weekend for dining out, I guess.... Stopped at Byrd's for drinks after work on Friday - here's our take on it. The place is confusing, and it would seem as though the staff is quite confused as well. We walked in and stood at the bar for a few minutes - we weren't sure how to go about scoring an outdoor table, so we thought it best to ask. Unfortunately, no one stopped to help us; the bartender stood on the opposite end of the bar, talking to folks. Waitresses zipped past us without a word. We went upstairs to check on things ourselves and it still wasn't clear if we could just grab a table. So it was back downstairs where we flagged down a manager who told us we could seat ourselves. Whew. Sat at a table outside for a bit before a waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything. We asked about drink specials - she wasn't sure if there were any; perhaps tap beers were $1 off? We ordered a few beers. And waited. And waited some more. And then we switched tables (the shade looked more inviting). And then our beers came out and the waitress was gone. We flagged her down for the check and waited some more. And then we left. Disorganized for sure. Drinks were reasonably priced, but that's about the only positive to share. Unlikely that we'll go back. :-(",1
3769,"I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again. It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited. We went in today for an after school mcflurry. The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty. The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been \""repaired\"" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables. This place gives me the creeps. So long McDonald's. I don't think I'll miss you.",0
14246,"I used to LOVE this place. After being here on a bachelorette party this past weekend, I wasn't impressed. It was waayy too crowded on a Thursday night. The crowd wasn't the usual crowd I see and I come to Vegas A LOT (5-6 times a year) Not sure if maybe I just had a bad day that day or was completely sober, I don't really know. All I know was I wasn't impressed. Where are the good looking people in Vegas hang out now??",1
9965,"On one of our many trips to Vegas, Minh and I met up with our friends Ashley and her fianc\u00e9 Taj for a late night dinner. This place came highly recommended by Kent D. Seeing the amazing reviews and all the yummi photos and not to mention they have Sangria, I was in! When I told Ashley where we were going she was overly excited, come to find out this is one of her favorite places to eat at. Now, parking here is hard, you will be making circles in the parking lot trying to stalk people coming out of the restaurant. Give yourself more than enough time is all I can suggest. A lot of their clientele are people pre-gaming before a night of drinking and dancing so it will be busy until about 11:00pm. They do not take reservation on Friday and Saturday nights either. Minh and I were the first to arrive; we put our name in and had a seat outside. We were told it would be no more than a 20-30 minute wait for a party of four. Our friends arrived just in time as our name was called about 10mins later. I think we only waited a total of 15mins or so which is awesome considering the place was packed when we arrived. Most of the staff was nice; we were lead to the back of the restaurant, which was fine for us. The place is loud and it can be hard to hear each other, so do not be surprised if people look at you if you are talking loudly so someone at your table so that they can hear you! Our server came by and took our drink order I had a White Sangria, while Ashley had a Mojito (which btw is super strong). The menu is impressive with what they have, wanted to order one of everything just to try it! Ashley made suggestions on what was the BEST; all her suggestions were true to her word too! I started out with trying (and ooo btw the White Sangria was prefect, strong and tasty... can I get a pitcher?!) -Ceviche of Shrimp-tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla -Steak and Mushroom Skewers- grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction -Ahi Tuna Skewer-mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze I was going to rate this with a perfect five but towards the end our server got sloppy and started forgetting orders. I ordered Empanada's and as the rest of my friends and boyfriend received their food; I was left sipping on my sangria wondering where my darn empanadas were. Well maybe they take some time to make I thought. Therefore, I let it go not thinking much until Minh realized that I still did not get my order. We tried to get our server attention, which took some flagging down. She finally came over and we asked her about my order. She stared at us blankly and said, \""Did you order Empanada's?\"" I said yes I did. \""oh, I didn't put your order in\"" When she walked back to the kitchen, I guess they were sitting there for awhile she came back and said that someone must have put the order in because they were sitting in the pickup line. Knowing that they were sitting for a while, I did not have a good feeling to eat them, so I told her never mind. She made kind of a stink about it so instead we asked for a box to take it with us. Would I come back again, yes! It's rare for me to say that if I had semi crappy service, but the food and sangria is just damn good!",3
48930,"I cannot tell you what the draw is to this place but it certainly isn't worth waiting for a table here. The pizza was the worst pizza we ever had, anywhere! It was bland, tasteless but with an occasional funky flavor mixed in. Very expensive pizza when you consider the poor quality ingredients it is made with. I can't complain about the service but they weren't overly busy when we were there. This was our first time going there and we will never go back.",0
2085,"Wow! So since we were on a budget we decided to go to the warehouse. I made an appointment 4 days before we would be there (coming up from prescott) and was able to get in no problem. When I got there I was immediately greeted and met with my consultant Rhonda. Oh Rhonda! She took everything I said into consideration! I was set on the trumpet style dress, but was open to other styles. Rhonda ran around the store twice pulling dresses within our budget! I found my dress in our first round! I did try on 5 total, each with great merits and parts I had told her I wanted. But #3 was the one I fell in love with. Rhonda also helped alot as far as veils and tiaras went, bringing the whole experience into all that it would be on my wedding day! I met with a store manager as well (Erica I believe?) Who was extremely nice and offered any help she could provide. All in all the experience was more than I could hope for, and am so grateful for Rhonda helping me through one of the most taunting tasks of my wedding haha.",4
2632,"Went for my second time this weekend, but not because the first time was good and I wanted to go back - someone else chose. The first time I had the ramen and it wasn't very good. I remember having left sort of let down and still hungry because I didn't want to finish what I ordered. This time I went with sushi. I got the dragon roll, spicy tuna and eel w/avocado. I'm no sushi expert, but I wasn't terribly impressed. The dragon roll was the best of the three, mostly because it was large and fried. It was all just alright. I've had better.",1
41991,"I bought a Groupon for them and first they would not fill the order because they were apparently too busy. When they finally got back to me by email they stated that they would deliver by June 11, 2013. With no communication as to why, it was not until yesterday that they finally delivered what were most arguably the worst cupcakes I have ever tasted. They lacked flavor, they were dried out and hard as a rock, the icing was slimy and flavorless, and I could not even make it through one of them before I was so disgusted that I threw the rest away. Horrible at best and I will never buy anything from that \""bakery\"" again.",0
9393,"The parking was absolutely horrible here, on the FIRST NIGHT. Ordered from the restaurant on site, and the nachos were horrible, THEY WERE SOOOO DRY . The regular rooms are too small. the restrooms are even worst. It feels like you're taking a shower and using the toilet at the same time, YIKES!!!!! Got a suite on the first night because I couldn't take it any longer. The suites are much better. they are way bigger than the regular rooms. If I ever went back here I would have to have a suite. They have newer flat sceened tv's in the regular rooms and the suites, which made up for all the other horrible things. so if you want to bring your ps2 or ps3 go for it . But I still had to deal with the parking. So I walked to Fremont area each day and night until I checked out. It sucked that I didn't get to visit any other parts of Vegas, but I've already seen everything anyways lol The staff including security are so antisocial its pathetic. They just stand around and look at you like ' What the hell are you doing here\"" they don't do anything but spectate. they are not helpful at all. they walk the other way, when they see you coming. The person who booked my room for me, Christina, was way cool. she is very friendly. If you see her, let her help you. Its definitely a budget hotel but you also get what you pay for!!!!!!!! I feel bad for giving this place 1 star.",0
39190,"How kind of Your Nail Gal Pam to respond to my review. However, she got a few things about me wrong that I'd like to correct. I am not a professional nail client. I'm a regular woman who gets monthly pedicures from an absolutely charming, competent and polite technician. She has never made faces at me, cursed at me, or indicated that I might break her equipment. She also works in a small space, however it is arranged so she and her clients are comfortable. Yes, I once wrote a series of articles for Nails Magazine, however, only one was about working with obese clients. I also wrote about hand treatments including plastic surgery, massage, clients with disabilities, luxury pedicure options, language barriers, and did salon reviews. When I was still able to work, I wrote on a number of subjects, including beauty, automotive, and more. I enjoyed my research and learned a lot. I never came to Pam with gels on my toes, nor did I ever ask her to remove gels that she didn't apply in the first place. She had a policy in place about gels and removals, and I respected that. Pam is certainly entitled to set up her salon space however she wishes...it IS her business. However, the pedicure throne is in a fixed position, and I fit on that, so her claim of being a contortionist is strange. She accused me of exceeding her chair's weight limit. Hmmm. I never mentioned my weight to her, nor did I weigh myself in her salon. Yes, I am fat. That's not easy to hide. And yes, bench style seating is awesome. However, I use pedicure thrones every month with no problem. If she was so concerned about her equipment, she could have asked me not to use it and suggested an alternative. Yes, I waited to write this review. I made notes after each visit, hoping to figure out what I could do to unleash this super tech that so many were swooning about. I dare say none of the beauty pros I work with now would consider me an undesirable client. True, my diabetes and severe arthritis might make me a challenge, but with open dialogue and common courtesy on both sides of the chair, issues are easily resolved. If Pam makes you happy and makes your nails gorgeous, then good for you. We all have choices. But if your experiences were more like mine, don't feel bad or embarrassed or think you did something wrong. There are plenty of nail techs out there who welcome clients who are differently abled. The tech I use now provides incredible, relaxing massage that makes me drool. Pam just made me sad and humiliated.",0
28365,Chicken fried steak and eggs rocks!!!!!!! Service was excellent. Very attentive. Portions were big and prices were fair. Location was easily accessible with plenty of parking. Restaurant was clean and coffee delicious. We loved it. Great weekend breakfast spot.,4
36898,"Pizza is like sex. Even if it's bad, it's still good. That pretty much sums up how I feel about this place. The pizza itself wasn't too bad. I liked the garlic stuff they put on the crust. I was disappointed that they screwed up my order and instead of pepperoni and garlic, I got pepperoni and olives. They didn't even apologize or offer to give us a discount or anything. We also tried their chicken fingers which were alright. Nothing special. You could tell they were the cheaper ones. For the price though, I'd go back again (2 med 2 topping pizzas, 5 fingers for $15).",2
16058,"I actually haven't been here in years but I do remember it well. I think if you love seafood, this place is totally worth it. There was so much seafood I didn't know what to eat. I think everyone generally goes for the crab as most of my friends did. Since I've never been a big Alaskan crab fan, I ended up mostly seafood noodles. Pretty good seafood noodles, but they really are just noodles with seafood. For me it was not worth it because of what I like, but I definitely recommend it to those seafood lovers.",3
13603,"If you haven't been to Munich, this is a good simulation. The beer is very good as is the authentic presentation. The food is also quite authentic, which may not suit everyone, since most folks haven't had German food in Germany. Seating is very traditional, so get to know your neighbors! Service is very attentive, but not obtrusive. What I'm not so happy about is the volume level (hard surfaces + amplified performers + crowd = noisy.) While I appreciate the authentic music, the routines can be disruptive. It's a long walk from the Strip, but definitely worth a cab ride if you like beer!",3
21784,"DE-LI-CIOUS!! I was about to leave for a road trip from the Bay Area all the way to Dallas. Of course, I noted all these places I wanted to stop to eat along the way. At the last second, I decided to watch the episode of \""Best Thing I Ever Ate\"" in my DVR about fried chicken. Thank goodness I did!! Or else I would have never discovered this restaurant. First off, they sell all their meals for $10.18 (plus tax). It comes with an entree and two sides. It's a HUGE plate of food. You could really eat it for two meals. The size of their drinks are monster, too. And for only $2.17! It'll make your plate full of food look small. I went for their infamous southern fried chicken and sweet potato and green bean with potatoes for my sides. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had! There's just enough batter to chicken. The skin is crispy and the chicken is actually moist! I could pass on the green beans (they tasted like canned green beans), but the sweet potato was awesome. The sweet potato had just enough sweetness, but you have to ignore the (possibly heart stopping) liquid it sits in. Sometimes it better not to know how some stuff are made. =P My hubby tried their chicken fried steak with rice and gravy and potato salad. The chicken fried steak has a flavorful, thick batter but it's still crispy. It totally looks homemade. The rice is your standard stuff, but the potato salad is yummy. They're open 7 days a week, but they close early at 7PM, so plan an early dinner! But on Fridays and Saturdays they reopen at 9PM for their Late Night Munchiez session. It's a different menu and made up of burgers, wings and other good late night munchies. Come here for the chicken first though. You won't be disappointed!",4
15444,"Mexico City is located on smithfield by the bridge and is without a doubt the best authentic mexican I have had in Pittsburgh. The staff is great, very friendly. The tacos are awesome...I think the homemade corn tortilias are the reason they are so good. I felt like I was back in sayulita, nayurit!! All the food is very fresh and flavorful. Enjoy because this is as close as you can get to the real deal!!",4
27942,"I am breaking my general yelping rule, and giving a place 5 stars on a first visit. But this place really earned it this weekend. The BF were debating coming here for restaurant week after having gone to a different restaurant the night before and being super disappointed. I'm really glad we decided to go. The view was nice, we sat right by the window by the fire pit, so we got to look out over the city and at the fire...it was pretty awesome. The rolls were delish....they were almost croissant -y. I ended up getting the restaurant week menu and the BF ended up getting a cheeseburger (he had wanted one all day). I started with a ginger marg at the waiter's recommendation...it was sooooo good. It was spicy with ginger...I kind of loved it. Also, it turned out that most of my food had a ginger note, so it paired really well with my meal. The BF had a nice pinot grigio, which paired well with his burger :-P. For an app, I got the butternut squash soup, which was a little gingery and not as thick as butternut squash soup usually is, but very delicious. For my main, I had the sirloin cap...it was awesome! perfectly cooked, and served with a puree that had a delicious gingery and fresh herb flavor. I could eat that steak anytime...it was wonderful. The burger was also delicious...it was thick and juicy, also perfectly cooked, and had really fresh veg on top and a really tasty onion ring. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake and it was amazing...chocolate just oozed out of it. I liked that it wasn't too sweet, but had a rich chocolate flavor. I will definitely be back here, restaurant week or not!",4
38211,"I was pretty disappointed with this place! Maybe its because I had high expectations after everything I've heard. The menu was pretty weak and I was surprised at the lack of variety. I ordered a flatbread pizza and it was good but pretty pricey! I'd probably go back but I'm not in a rush, hopefully next time it's a better experience.",2
26720,"Two days ago my husband and I went to Toast for my birthday. We`ve gone to this restaurant many times with mixed results, however, the last two years have been so uneven we don`t know what to expect. We had the restaurant week menu. The appetizers were very good. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the sausage. He had a very good soup and I ordered the salad which was suppose to be arugula but was maybe kale. At any rate it was terrible. Kudos to our waitress who brought me a spinach salad even thought I told her it wasn`t necessary. The blackened prime rib entree turned out to be tough pieces of sirloin. So while we`ve had some good meals at Toast we probably won`t be back.",1
19017,"The meat here tastes nasty-so nasty I had to send it back. I tried a curry chicken dish and the beef with eggplant. The curry was good if it was without the chicken. When I sent it back the lady got so mad and started yelling in her language =/ I felt so weird. What horrible customer service! And then she said to me, \""that is the last eggplant today-NO MORE.\"" I was like oooookaaayyy whatever that meant lol I would never ever come back. The restaurant looks dirty and there is no health grade rating posted anywhere (and we all know why). I wonder what they are trying to hide. Anyways, do yourself a favor and go to Thai Chili.",0
4319,"I went in to John Mario's a bit skeptical - you never know what you're going to get with any given hair salon. This was the first time I'd had my hair cut in Vegas, so I went completely off of online reviews (like this one). I requested a fairly challenging hair cut from my barber, Bill. I pulled up a photo of the style I liked on my phone and showed it to him. After studying it and talking it through with me, Bill went straight to work. Watching him work with the clippers was absolutely mesmerizing - you can tell the guy is a pro. I watched in awe as he shaped my raggedy mop into a style nearly identical to the photo I had showed him just 20 minutes earlier. The end result FAR exceeded my expectations! Needless to say, I highly recommend John Mario's - especially Bill. He's as talented with a pair of scissors and clippers as I've seen, and he can absolutely create the exact look you want.",4
42202,"The chicken was delicious. But for an $8 entree, I expect more than chicken cubes and sticky rice. Not a lot more but throw in a vegetable for cryin out loud. More importantly, the service was weak. I asked for an explanation of some of the beverages - and was told they were powdered. Now that's how to get me to give you my money... Really? They're powdered? Yummm. The grandmother, who clearly is passionate about her recipes, needs to whip those slack jawed, goth kids into shape, yell at them about their lack of a work ethic and fill them in on a few things -- first of which is pride in her food, how is it prepared, what is it...why should I care! I want to know...I'm interested, don't look at me when I ask these questions like I've grown horns! Then third...bus your damned tables! If you don't clean the tables, you can't seat new guests... Get busy! Votive candles on the tables don't make money...they're just a fire hazard. Or put them out in the afternoon when the sun is setting so they don't just look stupid. If a single guest comes in to eat lunch - and you only have 4 tops, don't keep asking them if they're sure they don't want to take their lunch to go...You designed the damned restaurant with only 4 tops and no counter space, it's not my problem. Get over it. And finally: More than 1 person should be able to handle transactions...but the cash register is in the wrong place. Honestly, it's a disaster. If anybody there had any previous experience in the restaurant business, they should be ashamed. I love Mom n Pops...but I hate rookie places whose only reason to be in business appears to be pissing off people who want to give them their hard earned money. But again, in their defense, I will repeat, that was some delicious chicken...and despite the fact that they say it isn't spicy, it was and it was good...just don't waste your time getting it with rice -- get two orders of the appetizer. To go. err.",1

8668,"Tempe improv was not what we expected, but better than we expected! When we got there we were seated at a small table with another couple whom we didn't know. A little awkward but making friends isn't a bad thing. Atmosphere was really cool - awesome uplighting and not a bad seat in the house! Can't really review the show itself, since they are different every night but the one we saw was pretty funny! Prices were a bit high, and they are strict about the 2 drink minimum, so come prepared. Mixed drinks were pretty good! Service was pretty crummy, but in all fairness she seemed new and they were at capacity. Other tables didn't seem to have a problem.",3
38070,"Wow, who was the genius that put a pizza place right next to Marquee? That guy should be rewarded like a BOSS because having the pizza literally 30 seconds away is about as clutch as you can possibly get. Again, this is why the Cosmo rules. Yeah, it's expensive, but what in Vegas isn't expensive? Usually $5 a slice, and that's before you get into multiple topping slices. Honestly though, at least the pizza is pretty damn good for $5. Crust is has good complexion. the cheese is delicious, and the toppings are always quality. They always make sure to stick it in the oven before they give it over to you, so it is piping hot when you get it. Ain't no other way to eat pizza than piping hot. My only wish is that they had chicken pesto pizza, but it's ok...I'll let you slide because your italian sausage/pepperoni and meatball pizzas are bomb as hell. Staff is great, very understanding and accommodating considering all the drunk, hungry people that pass by here between 2 to 5 AM. And not just that, but this place gets pretty entertaining because DRUNK PPL LOL. Last time I went and waited in line, some girl was going off about how she wanted to beat the crap out of another girl, but didn't out of respect for the bachelorette party. New night, new stories. Ah, good times.",4
1685,"I've stayed here twice before, and I think it's a wonderful place for anyone's who's visiting. Close the mall, movie theatre, Biltmore, and most importantly, Shreiner's Sausages. Really, though. It's always clean, roomy, good A/C. Probably one of the best Embassy Suites I've visited. And way cheaper than the Biltmore, for sure.",3
38546,"I found this place through Yelp! yesterday and ordered some delivery while I was working at-home. This place wasn't amazing but it's pretty good for American Chinese food and I will def. be ordering again. The menu is really varied which is awesome and they include all of your standard, traditional favorites. The delivery was fast (about 20 minutes). The only downside was the lady who answered the phone could barely speak English and had a really hard time understanding me on my phone number, address, and credit card info. But...it was totally worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, spring rolls, and steamed rice. All yummy. They even put the sweet and sour sauce in a seperate container which I love because it gives you control over how much sauce you want (hey, sometimes I just want the chicken without the sauce) and is great for leftovers. There is no other good Chinese food delivery in the area. A great find. Try it! You probably won't be disappointed or greatly impressed.",3

21014,"A 1 1/2 Stars from me! Dreadful! I spent the longest year of my life the fifteen minutes I spent looking for help in there! I wanted to know where the TV department was so I could look for HDTV's. No one knew where the TV department was! Finally, by use of my OWN EARS AND EYES I found it, saw high prices and left, thank God! Good service is \""How may I help you?\"" heard from many salespeople. I heard none at all, had the feeling it was because I was a white man in a store with Latino and Black salespeople. Unacceptable! Dreadful store!",0
16051,"My husband and I own a timeshare and decided to trade it in for staying at the Grand Chateau. I had read reviews that there was construction going on, but when we went, they were working on the inside of the rooms so we never had any noise issues. The location is great! It's located on the southern side of the Strip right by the Miracle Shops/Planet Holleywood. They have a shuttle service that'll get you about mid-strip and drop you off at the Fashion Mall which would often times spare our feet. The rooms were lovely. Granite counter tops, copper sinks, jacuzzi tub, duel shower heads, flat screen tv, I seriously couldnt complain. The wifi was really shoddy, but I was able to get online and make reservations while we stayed there. They dont have a casino and are 100% smoke free which is awesome because I cant STAND the smell of cigs and it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and lay your head down to peace and quiet. They have a small convenient store with overpriced items, but sometimes when you dont want to make the walk, it's nice to have one there. We didnt check out the pool as it was Feb when we went and much too cold so I cant comment on that. Service was always excellent and we'd DEFINITELY stay here again!",4
14938,"I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season. The place was empty and we got free upgrades. The show was amazing. The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw. There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the $.",3

I tracked her down from the other (not out of business, William Jon salon on the square). This time she cut my hair and did a wonderful job. She never makes me feel bad for what I did and she is willing to work with us who can't afford regular salon coloring visits and attempt to do it ourselves. She has been in the business 50 years and she knows her chemistry. I hear she is great with African American hair as well. Check her out.",4
14759,"Skip it. Nothing special here I have to say the store decorations, menus, utencils are high class, but the service and food was something you'd expect at an amateur Asian restaurant but very expensive. We ordered $20+ \""juicy\"" prawns and it just looked like fried prawns I could've done better. We asked for rice and they gave us one dried small bowl. They also brought the wrong food and insisted for a bit that we did order the items brought to us. Geez. There's a good reason this place had no customers, even when it's right next to their club. Don't be tricked by their posters around Paris. Oh.. another small rant. Since it's October, they had cotton wrapped around everywhere for the Halloween theme, but this looked terrible. Really badly done. A nice looking restaurant that costs a lot with cotton balls everywhere.. what are they thinking.",1

I didn't remember the name so we just went to the one with the highest yelp ratings and we were so excited to see we had hit it!Great mango lassis, seems like everyone in the restaurant was drinking them! And the staff is very friendly! Food excellent. We wanted to come back the next day for the buffet but we had so much leftovers we made our own buffet in our room!",4
23474,"04/29/1 Updated review 5 stars Well we have had the doors for well over year and I must say it's been one of our better investments. Other than the initial problems with the locks, they have held up well and look great. It's a pity we didn't have them installed years earlier. We can safely lock the 2 outside doors and leave our main front and back doors open all night to let a through breeze. It's great. 12/1/13 update review (4 x star) Locks seem to be holding up well and very happy with the doors otherwise. 11/7/13 updated review (3 x star): First Impressions finally did the right thing and sent out a more experienced technician. Both locks repaired without fuss. I guess the first technician they sent was very weak and gave me the run around with some ridiculous stories. I must admit I do like the quality of the doors and install was good. So not sure whether or not I should over-look this hiccup in service. upgraded from 1 x star to 3 stars. If the locks hold up i will move up to 4 stars Initial Review: (1 x star): Nice doors and good initial install. However, we have had a lot of problems with the locks. Key wouldn't come out when fully turned. We had the service guy come out and he said he couldn't replace the lock until it fully fails!!! We have to go through all kinds of contortions to get the keys out - it seems it has to be aligned up and down correctly before you withdraw the key. Now the front door is doing the same thing. That's just totally ridiculous... and incredibly frustrating. The doors are only approx less than a year old. If I had read all the bad reviews I see on Yelp about this company - I should have gone elsewhere - stupid me for not looking first.....",4
29051,"It's hard to find a rewarding donut in this city , and by rewarding I mean , that taste that brings back all the memories I associate with donuts. As a child growing up in Orange County, Ca., we had not only Winchells donuts but Mom and Pop joints that were usually ran by a sweet Asian family who knew how to make a great donut. You'd find them on almost every corner. From my earliest donut memories of stopping for donuts on the way to church or mom buying donuts for birthday party , or later when donuts provided me comfort during my parents divorce to the fun of buying a dozen donuts on the way home from a wild college night , donuts have been there for me , like my own sacred rite of passage thru my life. Okay that might be stretching it a bit.. but donuts are chocked with memories for me . So the anticipation was high as I decided on my sick day to stop for a comforting donut or two at Lamars. When I walked in I hoped that somehow a little ole lady would come out from behind the counter but no instead I ordered from the local chain . The first donut was an old fashioned , it tasted like it was right off of memory lane , sweet but not sickening, great dough , lightly iced. I was taken back to every yummy donut I ever adored... Great! I made my second donut an old favorite , pink iced cake donut ..here is where it all went horribly wrong .. the donut tasted dry ,over cooked,with a gaggy sweet non distinguishable icing...the horror... Well if you love donuts go to La mars maybe it was an off day for the frosted pink donut..and make sure to have a old fashioned donut for me..",2
42163,"These 1/2 price ticket booths are all over the strip, with nine locations from New York-New York on the south end to Circus Circus on the north end. Very helpful staff is there to answer questions and provide information about the variety of shows that are for sale. While they can't recommend a specific show, they are a font of knowledge and you can pump them with questions to get a good idea of the shows they think are the best. Don't even think about grabbing a show in Vegas without hitting the Tix4Tonight booth first. For $2-3 they also sell discounts for restaurants around the strip, some offering 50% off the price of an entree for everyone in the party. Check it out.",2
45964,"Love this salon! Conveniently located in the district. Brandi always does an amazing job on my hair! No matter if I'm going blond, or decide to go totally dark. Not to mention she gives the MOST amazing scalp massage I've ever had! Literally feel like a new person when I leave. I also like how private their little rooms are. Makes girl talk with Brandi that much better, and I don't have to hear all the other conversations going on, and they don't have to hear mine! 5 stars! :)",4

Especially this one..... well, I can't tell you, it's a secret. From beginning to end he was darb! No where else can you go and have a personal mixologist, in a private setting, and in Las Vegas, or anywhere! I can't really begin to decribe every single detail in this place. The thought that went into it is incredible. Everywhere you look you see something else to appreciate. I don't want to spoil anything. So all I can say is trust the reviews! I also have to give a shout out to the talented piano player that played for us, Spidoni (I hope I got that right). He is there on Wed night only. Great guy and plays beautifully. One last thing. I would definitely recommend going early. There are very few seats anyway, but my husband and I sure enjoyed having Dan, just about all to ourselves! Truly the BEST experience and can't wait to return!",4
35995,"Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, I was in the area and craved chicken wings. Got the wings & tenders combo. Totally gross! The wings tasted like cardboard and the tenders tasted like dirty socks. It was soaked in oil. A cholesterol overdose. The fries were ok. It was disgusting.",0
5480,"This place is sub par. The service is great and the staff are really friendly but the food is only edible at best. My wife and I caught an early dinner here last night. The decor was dated and the other patrons were all probably from Sun City, but whatever. We ordered the dinner special which comes with soup, appetizers and two main courses. We received the wonton soup first which was bland. Then we got out appetizers that consisted of fried wontons, fried shrimp and egg rolls. They were a bit greasy but edible. Finally came our main course of orange chicken, mongolian beef and bbq pork fried rice. The portions were a bit small and the food was flavorless. I never had orange chicken and mongolian beef that tasted quite like this. I mean I have had some terrible chinese food before, but the sauce they used for both dishes were pretty unique. Again, everybody was incredibly nice and I really wanted to like this place, but my taste buds won out. I know it's hard to find decent chinese food away from the spring mountain area, but there are definitely better than this(although I'm still searching for my go to place).",1
42565,"The sisig tacos, which I was so excited to try (SINCE WE LACK ANY GOOD FILIPINO FOOD TRUCKS HERE, like they have in Cali)... Well it was soggy, the 5 lbs of onions they used to try to hide the lack of flavor..it was all bad. Not the best first sisig taco experience. What a let down. Maybe ive been spoiled from Cafe Moda's awesome sisig. Whatever. It was just horrible. then the Longanisa fried rice. Tastes like cheap shitty fast food Chinese fried rice with bits of Longanisa. The only thing I enjoyed was the bistek Tagalog. It tasted like homecookin'. And really though with the iPad? The waitress takes your payment through this, and of course she has to type in what tip you gave her. Like you feel obligated to tip good to save face from judgement, even with their lack of customer service. Classless and tasteless.",1
12622,"Overall this a great hotel in Las Vegas. Casino is huge and plenty of tables to lose you cash at. Their sportsbook is in good shape and comparable to the Bellagio.

My gramps and I split one and we were both stuffed.",3

It's a little hole in the wall place with cheap drinks, a long happy hour, and tasty sushi. We go quite often and have discovered the only way to get good service is to either have the nice blonde lady who wears a tie and serves or the bartender Michelle. The other waiters get way too flustered when it isn't even busy. If you're looking for a new spot try this place out! If the decor was not so tacky (and paper taped up to the wall throughout the restaurant??) it'd get 5 stars from me and my husband. We'll be back :)",3

7089,"Was shopping around for a battery as the one in my car completely died. I called this store (among many others) and they had a great warranty- 3 years replacement, following 5 years prorated. After doing research I purchased a battery online at pepboys.com, with a 25% discount over $100 spent. I called again to ask if they had a discount for an oil change with a battery purchase (for a different car) and they said yes it would be $15. I told them I would pick up my battery and like an oil change and they said it would be no problem to get my in. Upon arriving to pick up my battery I was told it would be up to 3 hours for an oil change. We left and called a few days later and tried to make an appointment for an oil change and they kept telling me to just come in but I insisted on an appointment. We came in at 9 am when they opened and they had no record of our appointment. They took us right away but the oil change took an hour and half! and they left the maintenance light on! They also did not want to honor the $15 discount. Super annoying and frustrating working with this store, bad customer service. Would not recommend.",1

I have absolutely no complaints about the food itself. But I just can't justify coming here. The $$$ sign on Yelp should be changed to $$$$. Capitol Chophouse is definitely a pricey restaurant. I'm assuming it's because rent downtown, and especially within a hotel, is high. For the price you pay, there are surely better options out there. Try Tornado if you haven't already. Costs are more or less the same, but the quality and options are a lot better.",2
47907,"Sub par. Too expensive for too little mediocre food. Not likely to return. Beans are soupy and taste like dish water, better suited for a straw than fork. Salsa is horrible.

Finally after waiting almost 10 minutes asked for and got my check.",1
41632,"It pains me to write this because I've been a patron for many years buying various odds and bits when I couldn't wait for online orders to ship. But their repair service has repeatedly let me down to the point where I don't think I want to give them any of my business anymore. On the first occasion, they managed to completely lose track of a fairly expensive lens I had left with them to be repaired. They never called me with updates like they kept promising. I was always the one calling them, and having to re-explain my story to people who all gave me different excuses and were more preoccupied with shifting the blame than figuring out where my lens had gone. They seemed to be making time more than looking into it. Thankfully they eventually found it, but the ordeal took a few months. Good thing I had other equipment that could stand in. On the second occasion, my worries began on the day I left the camera with them because three employees were confused as to how the form was filled out, and whether that was the correct form at all, of course blaming someone else in the process. I was glad I hung on to my receipt. I was told they would contact me within about a week with an estimate. After three weeks I was still without news so I called them, and was told off-hand that because of the type of camera, it could easily take four to six weeks. I wasn't happy but it didn't look like I had a choice. Finally after two months with still absolutely no news from them, I called back and explained the situation. Apparently the repairman was waiting to get some additional equipment from me to test the camera. I asked why no one ever contacted me to tell me this. No answer. I asked how long that request had been pending. Apparently since after one week. I asked why I was told 4-6 weeks, and why no one checked my file at that point. He didn't know, and said 4-6 weeks is completely wrong. I'll now be dealing directly with the repairman, as it seems the Photo Service team is incapable of getting their ducks in a row, or of providing a suitable explanation for why things go wrong. Unprofessional and unaccountable are not qualities I want to see in people I let handle expensive photo equipment. Bottom line, if you rely on your equipment for work and need it back in a predictable amount of time - avoid this place. Having broken equipment is difficult enough; if you need the repair experience to not be an additional source of stress and frustration - avoid this place. In fact, probably best getting acquainted with mechanics and repair shops directly and developing your network of people who can stand by what they do.",0
28300,"This was my second visit. I had a great experience my first time in- very personable waitress, great service overall and a really great sandwich. I ordered the cheese-stuffed tenderloin with their \""signature\"" white sauce. Disappointment. The sauce was yellow (the waitress said it was because of the addition of paprika) but honestly, it tasted like cheese wiz but on the watery side. It did not have a good flavor- very bland. The pork was pretty tough for being a tenderloin and I wished I had a serrated blade with which to saw through it. Not sure what happened today in the kitchen. In the future I will stick with sandwiches. They do that pretty well. And even though I left half of my meal on the plate there was no offer to discount my meal- even by 25%, which would have probably made me happy enough to have not even written this review. Restaurants are a tricky business. You have to be great in the kitchen -or hire someone who is - and have a great business sense- or hire someone who does.",1

I was expecting a lot more choices but they did have a small variety and I ended up purchasing a dill havarti. They did have samples of three different cheeses. There is not a lot to talk about. I was expecting Elehnbachs or the Mouse House type experience but it was not quite up to par. If I had not been comparing it to those, I think it would have been fine. There is parking in the back. Take the walkway towards the front of the place. I got a little confused but it does make sense.",2
482,"I really like the atmosphere of this pub when we first went there. I liked how small and intimate it was. I like dark, candle lit bars. It just makes me feel a little more cozy. Unfortunately, the service was a bit lacking. It took about 10 minutes to get a beer (on several occasions) when there was hardly anyone there, and they charged us twice for 2 single Jameson's. We didn't catch this until we had gotten home. It's not that big of a deal, but considering we went on a night when it wasn't that busy, you think they would be paying more attention to what was going on in front of the bar (i.e. people waiting for drinks) and behind the bar (i.e. getting someone's tab right) I have a feeling we'll be going back. It was a great time regardless, but I guess there are some things that just leave a bad taste in your mouth. We'll be going back though. ;)",2

I could walk 10 feet without someone asking me if I needed help. It was very nice. I tend to wander so it was nice to have someone to point me in the right direction.

My fries were really soggy and not cooked all the way through and I couldn't bring myself to eat hardly any of them. Also, at the food pick-up counter, the lady was a real nazi. If you didn't have your receipt, you weren't getting your food. No exceptions. I get it, people can just walk up and grab whatever they want, but I only get it to a point. It seems to work out OK for places like In-N-Out. And really, who cares?? Everyone is drunk anyways!

18370,"Located within a dumpy strip mall across from UNLV, I find myself coming here all the time, and picking up 5 banh mi sandwiches for carryout for $15 total. The sandwiches are great - I put them in the over to toast up the bread a little and it's absolutely delicious. It's one of my regular places as a Las Vegas local. I have had banh mi in many places, including California and Virginia, which have vibrant Vietnamese communities. Oddly, the best one out of all of them thus far is here in Vegas. The bread is fresh and had a nice chewiness to it; the grilled pork sandwiches have pork that don't have too much gristle, and the sandwiches use good vegetables. The other inferior places I've been to have meager portions of meat, or cost $3.50 and upwards per sandwich, or had bread that I wasn't particularly fond of. I did have pho there once, and was disappointed by it; I go to Pho Saigon 8 up on Spring Mountain for my pho needs, but will often come here after a meal there for sandwiches to eat during the course of the week. I put in my order, and go to the Vons in the same strip mall to finish up some shopping (it's an incredibly ghetto Vons). The decor is pretty lousy, though they have a flat screen tv up. The service is spotty though I've been there enough times that they recognize me; they're not rude, but they aren't necessarily on top of everything. Cleanliness is average. The banh mi is prepared in the open area in direct view of anyone, which I like since it can help keep a kitchen honest. Value is solid because of the high quality of banh mi and reasonable prices. As said by others, you'll be best off if you stick with the sandwiches. Also, avoid the place during UNLV basketball games, cheapskates come out here to park rather than parking at the arena and it makes the entire lot a zoo.",3

I ordered the lamb, and it was very delicious and didn't take forever to cook like most restaurants. The side orders are ordered a la cart, and priced at 12 dollars. There not huge but good sharable size. There have a few choices in dessert, i choose the berry option, and it was very fresh and delicious, i believe all desserts were priced at 12 dollars as well. They have a large wine and drink selection. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing, not to stuffy and uptight, all the waiters and managers were nice and friendly making recommendations if asked. This steak house is located inside Cesar's hotel and casino.",4

Only disappointment was when I went to order soup because I like to eat savory food and that was it on their menu, they were out of everything. BUT I guess it left me wanting more because I will definitely be back to get some! I recommend making it your new coffee spot.",4
25719,"Absolutely incredible! The Gnocchi al Gorgonzola is to die for. My Caesar salad was also great. Our waiter was super friendly and was cracking jokes with us the whole time. Nice relaxed atmosphere, great eats, and fairly priced drinks. Got a table really quickly, and the service was fast and efficient. Two big thumbs up for this place :)",4
4965,"Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. First, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. Second, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. I highly, highly recommend against going there. Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably.",0
39159,I ordered the eggs rancheros. The tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick. My friend had the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.,0
2094,"Have been looking for a good deli around the office for quite some time now, decided to let Yelp help me and low and behold this is what I found.

Last time we were here, our order was short (we were charged for an item we never received), and I didn't want to come back at all, but my husband insisted. Today, I came to Yelp first and saw all the glowing reviews, and I thought, maybe it was just a bad day; I'll give them another chance. So I purchased and printed a Yelp voucher -- which they refused, because although the voucher stated clearly that it could be printed and that the business cannot make any additional restrictions, they claimed that they didn't have to accept the voucher if I didn't present it on an iPhone.",1
47576,The people here are super friendly and nice. Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin. I think if they remixed a few flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.,2
7077,Good parking. Although I am upset I had to pay $1 for my 30 minute parking. But that's Scottsdale for you. Nothing is always free. Even parking. Ilove all the shops here but they could update the map of the area because they are missing new places that have opened up.,4
25066,Hands down so far the best cheap eats pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. Big slices and the ones I have had (usually with garlic) have been loaded with lots of flavor. One is more than enough for me. Not particularly greasy like you would think for a pizza join and just oh so tasty. The crust is crisp and I like how after you make your pizza selection they warm it up in the oven. I haven't had anything else on their menu except for side salads with balsamic dressing (weird consistency initially though fine after mixing around) though I am very tempted to try their wings. Another perk is that they are opened late.,4
2740,Had purchased a oil change card from a fundraiser so I decided to try out Brian's. I called and made an appointment for 8:00 am for an oil change and tire rotation. I checked in and was told it would be about an hour. It's 9:15 and I'm sitting here staring at my car in the parking lot. When I asked Rick how much longer it would be he said they were finishing up another car still. And it'll be another hour until my car is done. Just be honest about how long the work is going to take. I would've just gone somewhere else or dropped the car off if I had known it would take this long I guess if you don't mind waiting around all day for a simple oil change then this is the place for you. I however had better ideas for my day off.,0
18178,"There is nothing i liked about this place at all, I came here because it was close by and had good reviews, however I am not sure why it does. I shared four sushi rolls with my sister and only sort of liked one of them. One had so much mayo on it I felt like I was just putting a spoonful of mayo in my mouth (I think it was called the super spicy roll.) It is also a very tiny place. Tables are so close together it makes it uncomfortable to talk to the person you are dining with... also it took a very long time to get our food soooo yeah I would not go back!",0

Nancy was very friendly as was Michelle. Though a bit expensive, still don't understand all the fees, I think it's well worth it. I'll be moving here next month and will update my review with a new one once I've settled in.",4
39396,"I am not originally from NY, but I can appreciate a good bagel...and these bagels are pretty good. The cream cheese flavors are also very good and made with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the Bacon, Tomato and Scallion...real bacon, fesh tomatoe and slices of green onion. My son tried the Chocolate Chip and the flavor was a bit flat. Not bad, but not WOW....which is what we were hoping for. We have also tried the Green Olive and Pimento and that was good, too. My husband likes the Cheddar and Jalapeno, chock full of sliced fresh jalapeno...seeds and all. I have been there for lunch a couple of times and have tried their Italian sub and Veggie wrap...both were really good! They serve Boar's Head meats. They also have a great selection of desserts and beverages. The coffee is ok. My son liked the Black & White and M&M cookies.",3
38968,"From the moment you arrive at Luxury Suites international you realize that what you paid for makes you less valuable as a guest than going directly through the hotel. The luxury suites are privately owned therefore you will not get the same service as the others staying in the hotel, something you should be aware of if you choose to reserve through amazon or travelzoo. The \""customer service\"" reps: Natasha and Nicole don't have a clue how to make guests feel welcome. In fact if you booked through Amazon or Travelzoo you will soon be aware that other guests booking directly with the hotel are treated differently. Sometimes it's difficult to put your finger on a person's attitude but in this case there is a bit of animosity for those who took advantage of a special. The hotel is nice but I can't emphasize enough, if you feel that Nicole or Natasha the two \""customer service representatives\"" have an attitude, it's time to call the hotel directly. Natasha treats guests as if they are asking for a handout. While the hotel itself has some wonderful qualities the team at Luxury Suites will make you regret booking through them. Whether you need a pillow, housekeeping or a razor (like most hotels will give you) you will be told told by the signature that this is not their concern. Better spend a few more dollars than dealing with these woman who believe that discount guests are more of a nuisance than a valuable part of their business. Furthermore, if you book through Luxury Suites International, a \""balcony vista\"" with a view of the strip is more like a view of another hotel. Beware as all rooms are non refundable. Live and learn.",1
37625,"I have previously professed my Vegas burger love for Stripburger, but Holstein's come in a very respectable second to my favorite burger spot on the strip, if only for the price. Holstein's is a fairly new face on the strip, but it has already far exceeded Burger Bar and BLT Burger, among the plethora of other mediocre upscale burger joints on the strip. The burgers are obviously top notch, and the creativity on some of the burgers is really refreshing; more importantly, it's executed perfectly. There isn't really much else that needs to be said about the burgers at Holstein's, aside from try as many as possible, because they are all good. What separates Holstein's from the ever growing crowd of burger spots is their appetizers. The kimchi quesadillas, the philly cheese steak eggrolls, the incredible pork buns - there is no way to properly describe how good some of these appetizers are. And the kicker, at least for me, is that they are different. How many places, especially burger joints, serve kimchi quesadillas? As far as I can tell, not too many. The incredible creativity that is seen in the burger menu is also seen in the appetizers and the rest of the menu - and again, it's all executed flawlessly. I personally am not a big drinker, but I have tried one of their alcohol infused shakes, and it was delicious as well. The service here is always great, but this place can get slammed in the evenings and the bar can get rather loud, especially if there is a big game on the TVs, so I would definitely recommend this as a lunch destination if possible. Bottom line: if you're looking to spend a bit of money for a good burger, Holstein's should be your go to spot from here on out.",3

21656,"Visiting Penang for the first time this past weekend, and I have to say this is probably one of the most authentic Malaysian cuisines I've tried in the West Coast. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've practically tried every Malaysian/Singaporean restaurants/cafes in the Bay Area. This restaurant outclass all of these wannabe's including the ultra-pretencious (and unreasonably expensive) Straits Cafe. I normally go to Satay Malaysian Grille when I am in Vegas...i thought their satay was really good, until I tried Penang this trip. I went they twice in a row this trip, ordering their Hainanese Chicken rice (excellent!) and chicken satay (even better than Satay Malaysian Grille, esp. the satay sauce). Also ordered the Cantonese Style Seafood Chow Fun, which is quite good, but frankly, the one at Satay Malaysian Grille is a tad better. Overall, both Satay Malaysian Grille and Penang Malaysian are very very good... far better than any of the so-called Malaysian/Singaporean places in the Bay Area (with the exception of Rasa, located near the San Jose International Airport). Penang Malaysian edges ahead in terms of authenticity and price point (about 10-20% cheaper than Satay Malaysian). Sadly, the business at Penang is nowhere close to its arch rival, which is also on Spring Mountain Road, probably due to the fact that it's a much further away from the strip, hidden in a local Asian strip mall. In my opinion, \""da-best\"" Malaysian restaurant/cafe is still the Nyonya in NY's Chinatown! That's a absolutely 5-star rating!",3

2423,"Great place to see a sparkling city-lights view at night. Also a great place to experience some (slightly hokey) western atmosphere. I love bringing out-of-towners to this place as they feel like they got a \""real southwesterny\"" experience. Unfortunately, the food can be kinda hit-or-miss. One night, all our entrees came out cold. Another time, our steak was mostly fat, hardly any meat. It is kinda pricey for what you get, but it's worth it if you want to show a visitor a good time. The FRY BREAD makes it all worthwhile too. Definitely call ahead for reservations on a weekend evening.",2
41265,"Since being pregnant I've had a craving for none other than pizza. Pizza in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. Every meal. Pizza. Needless to say, I did drive from Henderson to Summerlin to FINALLY try Dom DeMarco's. Beautiful restaurant in a great Summerlin location. Excellent service. Dom DeMarco's actually has the recipe to DiFara's pizza, consistently rated best of Brooklyn, and it was such a treat to have a Brooklyn favorite right here in Vegas. The sicilian pie has the thickest, flakiest most delicious crust. You just don't find a square pie like that ANYWHERE else in town. Heard a rumor that they may be pulling the trigger on a Green Valley location! Please do! I've been craving their square pizza pie a while now but going to Summerlin for pizza seems almost as inconvenient as going to Brooklyn.",3
21088,"So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send. We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. I ordered the \""Penne Arrabbiata\"" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the \""Baked Lasagna\"" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up \""Party Pans\"" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!",3

I dragged two co-workers of mine over there, and I got a carne asada burro, side of chips and guacamole. The service was ok, not too friendly, and didn't try too hard. That's ok, it isn't fine dining. The prices were higher than Chipolte, so maybe the flavors were better? Getting back to the office we started in on this lunch. The best way to describe it, is space food. They say that in space food doesn't have flavor, so on the bright side, for the cost of lunch it was like being in space. The carne asada had ZERO flavor. The guac had no salt, garlic, nada. Just avacado. So weird? The rice in the burro had no flavor either, I don't know if the food was props for movies, or what? Skip this place, go a mile down the road for Chipolte, or head just West to America's Tacos.",0

33570,"CenturyLink is the epitome of the kind of company I avoid giving my business. I signed up for CenturyLink prism and internet for a promotional price in exchange for agreeing to a 1 year contract. It wasn't until installation they told me that I would not be able to get more than 1 HD station at a time because of my location. This was after I made a 1 year commitment. The internet was very flakey. Over the 1 year I spent as a customer, the internet went down on average about once a month. Almost every time I called there was an automated message informing me that my area was being upgraded and I should expect internet outages. Do they really expect me to believe they did major upgrades that many times in a single year, and really they just can't keep their network from crumbling on a monthly basis? The one time my internet was down and it wasn't because of \""upgrades\"", the problem turned out one of their installers unplugged me at the central box while installing another customer. They did not offer me a credit or any other compensation for my outage caused by their tech. Over my 1 year contract, the price the sales person guaranteed me during the sale only lasted a few months before I started seeing small increases. Every month or two it seemed my bill would go up by a small amount, and by the end of the year my bill was a good 20% more than the promised price. At the end of my 1 year, I cancelled my service. I paid a pro-rated bill for my last month and was happy I was done with this horrible company for good. NOT SO FAST!! I received a bill in the mail for 17.32 for a \""service order charge\"". I called to inquire and was told that it was because they had to send a tech to their central box to turn off my service. I'm not sure why I have to pay for that, and I doubt it is actually true. I asked the service representative if such a charge is approved with the public utilities commission. She said that it is, but I think i'm going to contact them anyway to make sure before I pay the bill. They really have the nerve to charge me $17.32 to turn off my service?!?!?! I guess they know how bad their service is, and that customers that leave are never coming back.",0
27827,"Ate here the first night my boyfriend and I got to Vegas. We were blown away by the decor of the restaurant, the quality of the food, the taste, and the price. I ordered the veggie pizza which might very well be the best veggie pizza I've ever had. The crust was soft yet crunchy on the bottom. The grilled veggies on top were amazing. All the flavors were amazing on the pizza. I think it was only $13. I had like 4 slices to take home after eating 4 in the restaurant. We went back a second time and got mashed potato stuff eggrolls for appetizer. They were pretty good but they needed something more. Maybe the bacon since we ordered it without. I was craving asian food and got the zen noodles thinking it was a stir fry. Turned out to be a makeshift version of pho. Not good. A miss with that one. But I'm still stuck on the amazing pizza so I forgive them for the noodles. My bf ate a burger which he said was really good. This place is also 24 hrs. Amazing ambiance, price, and food for Vegas! Watch out for crazy drunks at night.",3
42884,They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home. The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake. Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No. Not even an apology.,0
40371,"I booked a party bus here for 18 people and the service was great. Booking went smoothly, they called to confirm the day of the event, and the driver was actually a little early to pick us up. The driver was very patient while we got our group together and sorted everything out. Our only plan was to drive around for 2 hours from downtown Las Vegas to The Strip, and our driver suggested that we stop at the welcome to Las Vegas sign for a photo opp. This was a great idea. He was also very accommodating when we had to make an emergency pee/booze stop. The bus itself was nice and had all of the basics, but it definitely would not have sat 20 people very comfortably and was maybe lacking a little glam (can't a girl get some bubbling lights on her birthday?). Like I said, it had all of the basics, and the service made it worthwhile. Also, it was the best price I found online after a pretty extensive search.",3
46853,"Was visiting Vegas, and stopped at Aces and Ales based on seeing it on BrewDogsTV. Overall extremely disappointed, and probably would not come back or recommend to others. Food/Beverage:(5/5) Unfortunately didn't make it to food, so I can't attest to the quality of the food. The menu choices looked really cool, and I really would have liked to try some of the things. We were fortunate enough to go during their Dark/Rare takeover so there were some GREAT choices on tap (Had Xantus, FW Proprietors, and other excellent curated choices) It was clear from there bottle cooler (including FW Barrel aged verticals) that they really care about beer, and are glad to share it. I would have spent a ton more money here, because the beer selection was great. Decor: Not bad but not great, (3/5) seating and layout is a little weird, I am not a local, so I don't know the history on this building, but it was just weird. We sat in a community-ish booth in the back corner of the restaurant. Service: (0/5) if I could assign a negative score for service I would do so, and normally I wouldn't give a restaurant a low yelp review for service alone because I know everyone can have a bad day, but the bottom line is the server didn't make it right at all. When we walked in without even saying \""Hello\"" to us, the server handed us the beer menu and said, all of these are 8oz. pours, and they are $8 per pour and this is \""Non-Negotiable\"" and mentioned something quickly about a tasting package and walked away. They were not particularly busy, and she was observed talking with her co-workers, and commiserating with what I assume are regulars that were not seated in her section. She made me feel like a criminal and i am totally the type of beer geek who wouldn't bat an eye at spending $50 on a bomber of beer. One member of my party was so put off by her attitude that he considered walking out without ordering anything, but I pressed on and wanted to give her a chance to redeem herself. She didn't come back for a while, and just brought waters, we were ready to order, but she didn't even ask, and went back to talking with other patrons. finally, several minutes later, another cocktailer came by who was sweet as pie and asked what we needed. We said we were going to just have beers and that we were so put off by the attitude of the other server that we were not going to be eating unfortunately. She apologized and promptly took care of our beers (which were on point). This would have been a turning point for our service, and I was warming up to the idea of ordering food, but apparently the new (and awesome) server had gone back and told the other server about our displeasure, and she came over for an \""apology\"" which really was a confrontation and her telling me \""People here know me, and love me\"" I am always a even keel, mild mannered guy, and normally would have just walked out and never looked back, but honestly, given her attitude, and then basically coming over with a half-hearted apology for \""The way you feel\"" I was done, and told her that she \""can treat her regulars like that if she wants, but she doesn't know me, and I don't appreciate that\"" All in all, if you get the right server, this place is probably good, maybe even great, but this was a horrible experience, and almost ruined my trip to vegas.",1
34693,"My husband and I are massive Big Lebowski fans and we have been looking for an excuse to go here for a while, so when a pub quiz was on offer we were on it! Any bar that has 25 different versions of a white Russian has to be worth a look, and the select few we sampled did not disappoint, for me hands down the \""toe\"" was the winner. Ever wondered what it would be like if it was socially acceptable to drink down some alcoholic melted mint choc ice cream? Wonder no more.......its magnificent! I'm sure I could easily lose several weekends working my way down that list with a big grin on my face. The food is equally impressive. At first glace its your usual pub spread of pies, burgers and the likes but in the social spirit of things I opted for the carnivores' sharing platter, not really knowing what I had ordered. Turns out it's a jam packed board of the most beautifully cooked chicken skewers, steak strips, ham and smoked salmon that I have had the fortune to encounter. All served up with plenty of bread, oatcakes, salad and the likes to keep a whole table full of foodies happy! For \u00a320 i call that a result. Over all a great place with friendly knowledgeable staff, comfy booths and an excellent ambiance. Don't be put off about the \""theme bar\"" status, I think if I wasn't a fan of the film I wouldn't even notice the references. The place holds its own amongst the most cosy and stylish places around. Just an afterthought really, this would have been a 5 star but 2 things let it down. Ladies toilets needed some fixing up (missing locks, no TP, broken taps with hand written 'do not use' signs....you know what I'm talking about) and after the quiz was an open mic night. Now I'm all for letting people have a go and their 2 mins of fame but I'd still like to be able to hear my friends talking without having to scream at them to repeat themselves. Ended up calling it a night within 5 mins of the open mic starting. Maybe I've just got delicate ears?!",3

32996,"I'm only giving this review 1 Star because the system won't post without a star. Where do I begin?.. I switched to Homelife Protection home warranty last Sept 2012 since my other Warranty co price was going to increase sharply and previous service call experiences were unsatisfactory. Today I called Homelife to get service ASAP due to Water heater not working since Saturday. I even submitted a claim online. Never recieved an email reply showing recieved and being handled ASAP. Called Monday morning and was advised they would have someone call me shortly and explained it may cost me an additional $850.00 for replacement of water heater if has to be replaced. Now in the details of what is covered it states they cover up to $500. for water heaters. I had already priced water heaters at 2 different places and found them priced from aprox $218.00 and up. The warranty co had advised the installation and additional parts needed are not included and i would also still need to pay the $45.00 service call. I advised I had read that they can opt to pay us the $ instead for the replacement. Now this is where it gets interesting. The warranty advisor checked our acct and stated there had been NO Payments since Oct 2012. I advised that's impossible since I was set up on Auto draft since acct set up last Sept 2012. I looked at my checking acct on line all the way back to Oct and found yes indeed that was last payment they drafted. How I hadn't noticed ..not sure. I asked why they had stopped drafting my acct and they claimed there was a \""general error code\"" and it effected not just me. I asked why didn't they contact me via phone and or email. They claimed they did try to call me. But somehow they had wrong phone # when I asked them to verify # they had been calling. I asked why they didn't email me then? They claimed \""we don't do that\"" then why do they keep my email on file in the 1st place? Hmmmmm. But they were prompt to state they could take 2 months payment over the phone right then to resolve the issue. I told them NO Thanks! You've already shown your Incompetence as a Company and I will No Longer be doing business with them! Needless to say I got a Brand New Water heater for just $259.00 today from an appliance store and my husband installed it per instructions. So the moral of the story is: A Home Warranty is Worthless and will cost you more $$ in 99% of the cases!..Especially one like HomeLife.",0
35944,"Der 22.September 2012 sollte unser Hochzeitstag werden! Eigentlich hatten wir schon eine Location f\u00fcr unsere Hochzeit gefunden aber als wir selber G\u00e4ste bei einer Hochzeit im Pflug waren, haben wir uns nochmal umentschieden. Es war eine gute Entscheidung im Pflug unsere Hochzeit zu feiern! Unseren ca. 60 G\u00e4sten hat es allen sehr gut gefallen im Pflug. Das Essen war sehr lecker, es gibt eine gute Bierauswahl (das war wichtig weil viele Bayern zur Hochzeit geladen waren) und der Service war auch einfach nur super. (Und das alles f\u00fcr einen guten Preis!) Das tolle bei privaten Feiern im Pflug ist, dass alles so unkompliziert ist. Egal welche W\u00fcnsche wir hatten, man konnte uns alles erf\u00fcllen. Im Pflug gibt es eine Musikanlage und einen Beamer die genutz werden d\u00fcrfen, was wir auch gemacht haben. Es hat uns und unseren G\u00e4sten sehr gut gefallen und wir wollen uns alle beim Pflug-Team f\u00fcr unsere gelungene Hochzeit bedanken! Solle mal wieder eine Feier anfallen, wissen wir wo wir hingehen werden ;-) Liebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe Anna & Christian",4
28474,"I booked rooms for my mom and my uncles at this local B&B for the weekend of my wedding. They had a fantastic time here. The Parador is located in the middle of the business district of Allegheny West on the North Side of Pittsburgh, which makes it extremely convenient to PNC Park, Heinz Field, the North Side museums, and downtown cultural events. The inn takes up an entire beautifully-restored brick Victorian-era house, and also the carriage house in back. A really nice man named Ed runs the Parador, together with his cute Black Lab, Razor. (Razor is perfectly trained and quite the gentleman -- there is also a stash of treats for him in the B&B's kitchen, if you can't resist slipping him something.) Ed was so gracious and such a wonderful host that I ended up feeling sort of bad that I hadn't known about this place before, because I would totally have gotten married there! The inn itself is absolutely beautiful. The entire interior has been completely renovated, but with furnishings and other decorations that remain in keeping with the Victorian style of the building. The guest rooms are not rooms, but huge, luxurious suites (the smallest of the guest rooms is a 328-square-foot room - bigger than many studio apartments), and the common areas are welcoming and comfortable. This B&B has the typical amenities (in-room TV, phone, coffee maker, full American-style breakfast each morning, wireless access, hair dryers and laundry stuff, little fridges) with some bonuses you don't always see (the decanter of port on top of the piano in one of the common rooms, the giant full private bath in each of the rooms, a conservatory room). There is no gym in the house itself, but you can get a free pass to the Allegheny YMCA (only about three blocks away, and a pretty great institution in its own right). Prices to stay here are shockingly low at $150/night. This is the same price you would pay to stay at a chain hotel, getting a fraction of the space and none of the individualized attention, impeccable hospitality, or unique style you will find here. You should stay here if you're coming in from out of town. I fully intend to stay here if I ever feel inclined towards a miniature romantic getaway or something. It's a pretty great spot.",4
259,"Ritters is a Pittsburgh treasure. Old school diner, complete with at-table mini jukeboxes that sometimes work. Great people watching here. This is the place you come for late night munchies or possibly morning after recovery. Breakfast food is on point, as is the Greek fare. Cash only like most of the coolest spots in The Burgh!",2
37110,"This is one of my local supermarkets. I see myself coming here once a week they always have specials, plus the staff is very friendly. They have a variety of stations We can start off with the Bread/cakes They have a wide and cheap assortment of breads and cake that you can choose from. Its freshly baked everyday. I would highly recommend as that you give the stuffed bolio a try. It has jalapenos and cream cheese baked on the inside.The cakes are great as well. Meat Dept Every week they run great specials on different meat or seafood. It is very clean and organized. (Sometime the lines are really long but worth it cuz there are some cute guys in the back) Produce I would be careful when looking at the produce from my perspective they have cheap cheap produce, but sometime they have a lot that is on the verge of going bad. Hot food This is the best they have carnitas, chicharron en salsa verde, beans, rice, fried onions, fried jalapenos, and boy oh boy oh boy they are effin delicious. They have family packs where you can get 2lbs. of carnitas (pork meat) beans, rice and tortillas for around $18.00 bucks. Enjoy. I might have missed something, I will edit as I go along.",4
33909,"AVOID ALL the Walgreens on the Strip!! They are nothing but TOURIST GOUGING BUSINESS'S & not your neighborhood store you may be accustomed to. For Example: I went into this store & brought my Arizona Iced Tea & pack of .99 cashews to the register & told the clerk \""The Iced tea is on sale this week\"". She then asked if I had the coupon. I told her NO & asked her dont you have a Sales paper for this week?\"" She answered \""NO.\"" WTF?!! I then pulled out a reciept I just happened to have from a store I was at on Maryland blvd & showed it to her explaining that I DID NOT have a coupon then either and the store had a sales paper to accomodate me. She said she couldnt help me. I told her get the mgr. The mgr came and explained that I needed to have a coupon. I showed her my reciept and told her I've NEVER heard of a Walgreens that didnt have a sales paper to accomodate customers and went on to say QUITE LOUDLY that all they were doing was \""gouging tourist\"" by not honoring their weekly sales paper or making it available. I left and will NEVER solicite any of these STRIP stores ever again & I will be venting with Walgreens mgmt via the 1800-763-0547 number. Avoid these STRIP stores at all cost!!",0
45722,"Best burros, ever! Had the green chili burro, enchilada style with green sauce and the bean burro enchilada style with red sauce. AWESOME. The family vibe was even better! Marissa, is very welcoming and kind.! It will be my weekly stop! I'm serious! The Munoz family has proven how good they are by their success of Rito's in Central Phoenix. We are so lucky they have brought their good stuff to the west valley!",4
18270,"Man, this place could use a good algae rinse. The moat-like water feature at this place smells rather nasty if the temps tick above 80\u00ba. Luckily, the rest of the park is rather nice and sprawling. There's usually a great place to have a picnic or throw around a frisbee. Unfortunately, the ball courts on the south side of the park are a disappointment. It's hard in Central Phoenix to find nice basketball courts. At least there's several courts, but you have to buy a membership ($10) to use them. Perhaps that's why they're usually empty. The adjacent raquetball courts look like something out of the 'Saw' series.",2
32835,"The food is excellent. I had the chicken and waffles. The portions were huge! Two chicken breasts and four thick waffles The chicken was crispy and juicy. The waffles were tasty. Crisp on the outside and cakey on the inside. If some people don't like the waffles I think it's because they don't realize the waffles should be crispy and not spongy like most diner and frozen waffles are. Also people that say the waffles are tough may not realize that there is a piece of thick cut bacon baked into the waffle. The maple reduction is good but I would have liked a little more. I did ask for additional syrup. I also sampled the chorizo jalepeno scramble. The eggs were fluffy and the chorizo was nice and spicy. The potatoes were well cooked and tasty. The biscuit was little dry and could have used some butter or jelly. The issue was with the service. Our wait for table was only five minute but I can see how at peak hours it's much longer. Our server took our orders very quickly and brought us drinks right away, however, it took a while to get refills. It did take a while for our food to come out and when it did the scramble was brought out about five minutes before the two orders of chicken and waffles. I hope this was due to the busyness of the restaurant and the fact the food was clearly prepared fresh. It was worth the wait.",3
11499,"First off, dont be fooled by the all you can eat sushi thing. My whole family went and it succkkkked! The uni was all black, the service was junk, the manager talked back to us after they tried to give us deep fried scallops when we ordered sashimi. When you order, they give you a lot of the cheap stuff like salmon and the uni is very little. We literally, literally! Had to wait 15 min for our tea. Becuz its an all u can eat, they only give u a little of the good stuff. Do not go here. Go to a more expensive restaurant and get what u paid for. Not some cheap quality seafood. I was so pissed off with this restaurant that after we gave them the check, i spit on the plates and i stuck my middle finger on the way out. Its junk, dont try it. I'd rather go to genki sushi then this. Oh yeah, and my mom got sick the day after.",0
33067,"The item I wanted when I went thru the drive thru wasn't available, the black pepper chicken, which was fine, it happens sometimes. So I picked 2 other items that were, the sweetfire chicken and the honey walnut shrimp. after paying for my items, the lady at the window asked if I wanted some soy sauce, I said yes and then asked her for some rice wine vinegar. She then said, what is that? now I don't know if y'all sell that at all, but I enjoy a sauce similar to that at my local Chinese delivery place. I don't know your menu selections because frankly I have only been to a panda express once or twice before... Now back to the order of food when I got home.... Well, both of the items I selected were very soggy with cooking oil, every bite I took just flooded my mouth with an oil taste not the flavor of the sauces I was expecting. The chicken had pieces that were nothing but breading and very hard. The chow mien noodles were even really oily and not cooked properly, they were hard to chew, rubbery. It was overall very disappointing to me. I don't think I will return to this store anytime soon.. I'll stick to my favorite delivery place, they are cheaper in price, and the quality and quantity of food is great.",1
9534,"I love Baseball; I grew up playing it; watching the Orioles live and rooting for the Pirates/Twins on TV and now I'm an upset Cubs fan; I've been to 18 MLB parks and 4 different minor league parks; as far as Cashmen field is concerned they are the top of minor league parks I've attended and even beat out a few of the Major league parks; As far as the 51s are concerned, well they are the Blue Jays affiliate so you can't expect too much from them but go figure they were in first place most of the season this year (I had seasons tickets thank you Shari) and got to see many of the games. The fan interaction is high, they are there to watch the game; participate in the between inning activities and for the most part don't get up and ask you to move during the live action on the field (there is always one person though) The misters aren't always on behind the back stop and there is a sign saying they only turn them on during low humidity events; I have to wonder when is it not a low humidity event in Las Vegas? Maybe during the one or two weeks we get rain but otherwise they should be on every day. But I digress; The hidden gem is the club house upstairs; the general admission ticket prices gets you into it; there you can watch the game from an AC skybox; get there early buy the buffet and find a seat with a view it will blow you away to watch a game in a comfortable temp.",4
36729,"Food was as good & fresh as any Hong Kong Dim Sum. I was impressed with the freshness of the vegetables and light sauces and the Chicken congee was outstanding. Price was very good for the work that goes into making all those little tid-bits of heaven. Found Mekong Palace by seeing that Phoenix Yelp Breakfast Club was having an UN-official meeting there, so it must have been tested out to be good, reviews were all good, no brained and so glad we went. It is inside the mall, really. It takes up a wing of space......interesting it is not enclosed by drywall or short ceilings, a new concept in placement of mall use.",4
28575,"The best Hawaiian food that I have had. I had the chicken katsu and Kalbi short rib mixed plate ($12.49) Chicken katsu was crisp and good. Kalbi short ribs had a charbroiled flavor. Hubby got the Laulau, the special for Friday night, which was very good too ($11.99) Large portions at reasonable prices. We were there on a Friday night and they had live Hawaiian music. I really wanted to try the Huapai cake but was way too full but it looked great. It was very busy though but only a short wait, maybe a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. We will definitely be back.",3

12304,Surprisingly this spot did the trick for my creeping hangover after an all too long night of pretending to be rock star!!! They don't deliver but you can do take out so that you can enjoy your meal poolside! I'd highly recommend the chicken sandwich. It's ginormous so share it with a friend or two! It also includes chips and pickles. The staff were super friendly even offering complimentary coffee to go (I can only imagine what I must have looked like to warrant this offer but anyhoo). Everything tasted fresh and was prepared in a timely manner. If want a meal that you can eat while sitting by one of the many pools at the Bellagio then I'd definitely recommend!,3
44404,"It's as good as everyone says it is. The biggest negative is that the restaurant isn't bigger. They need a larger space to accommodate the hoards of hungry diners waiting to eat here. For our family of three (two adults and a four year old) we got two orders of the \""meat and three\"" which was a reasonable $32.32. The proteins consisted of the beef brisket and half of a roasted chicken. The chicken -- unfortunately, a little dry -- was one huge bird. We had enough for leftovers the next day. The brisket was simply amazing. Calling it the best brisket in town might be justified. It didn't matter that there weren't any more knives at our table because it was as tender as a well cooked pot roast. Out of the six other items we got, the fried brussels sprouts were the runaway hit. They were crispy to the point of almost being like potato chips and so good that I'd be happy to eat them and nothing else on a return visit. The green beans were delicious and the two orders of mashed potatoes were good, especially if you like them smooth and creamy. The butternut squash had a consistency and the look of mashed sweet potatoes. The last item, an oreo pudding, was very good without being too sweet. The best seat in the house might be the communal table. If you don't mind having dinner with complete strangers you could be entertained by the people around you. Two of the people across from us were great to talk with and made the meal that much more enjoyable. It was a great experience all around with the delicious food and good company.",4
16074,"Pretty good for a buffet! Hubs and I got the all day city pass buffet deal. So for $50 a person we could eat all day at the buffets in 6 of the casinos in LV. The exceptions we a $20 upgrade at the buffet at Caesars and $10 upgrade for the seafood buffet at the Rio. Totally worth it as we had breakfast at Paris, a mid-day snack at Paris (our hotel), and then dinner at the Village Seafood Buffet. Hubby also added the all you can drink wine for $12. Yeah, don't do it!!! It's $6 a bottle el cheapo wine (or Busweiser or something if you go for the beer option) that will give you a hangover. The food was really tasty for buffet. And it was warm. And the desserts were good. And our server was so, so nice. I have a feeling that no one in my group remembered to tip her and I feel really, really bad about it :(",3

I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted \""off\"", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all. Then came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty. I tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain.",0

16914,"I used to be a big fan of Flat Top. I used to go there at least once a month. Then the price went up, you had to pay extra for shrimps, so I started going there less frequently. I went back there again today for a quick late lunch. Flat top lunch used to be a bargain for lunch take out at $7.50. I went there today and upon paying I got a bill for $8.99 even though on the board it says lunch price is $7.99 for students. I talked to one of the waitresses there and she's like that's just how it is, we just raised the price up EVEN THOUGH on the board it clearly says $7.99. I said that's a shady business practice, you can't charge someone extra for something that's not stated on the menu, and she said she can't do anything about it, and that i'll have to go talk to the manager. I talked to the manager, and he said the price just went up. Again, the board (which displays the menu and the price), says $7.99. Once he found out that I was getting a take out, he said oh the student discount is only for dine in. Again, this is not stated anywhere on the board or in the menu. I used to come here a lot, and I always got student discount with take out. I was not pleased with the tone of the manager and his sketchy business practice, so I just decided to dine in. A new, very nice waiter came by and apologized for everything. she was really nice and was sorry for how I was being treated. She got me the dine in plate and asked if I want to box it to take it home, and that's what I did. The extra $1 doesn't mean much. I gave that away as a tip to my amazing waitress. I'm just against shady business practices. And the food? the food is great. Service is usually good. I've dealt with the manager two times, and I felt like he's a rude and shady person.",1
19673,"We arrived around 10pm after a long drive, checked in, but I alone lugged all of the bags to the room, while my girlfriend ran an errand, only to find it messed up and not clean. The bed was all torn up, towels all over the floor, trash in the trash cans, iron out, completely disheveled. So I called and was told to return to registration for a new room, meaning that I had to lug the bags all the way back to the registration desk. I was given a new room alright, but no apology, nothing. In fact, both the worker on the phone and the registration clerk acted like this was a perfectly normal situation. Too tired to jump to a different hotel tonight, but we cancelled our remaining days and moved to a different hotel in the morning--even paying extra for an early check-in. This was my first and last stay at SouthPoint, and I refrained from gambling or spending any additional $$ in the restaurants. I don't know about you, but it feels really gross to walk into someone else's unclean hotel room when you are expecting a nice clean squared away typical hotel experience.",0
11932,"Mmmmmm... burger bar... Okay, so we found this place in a Japanese guide book and we were worried that it might not still be around... so we schlepped out there and arrived to find the place was hopping. We didn't have to wait too long to get a seat. The menu at this place is amazing. Basically, you construct a burger with whatever toppings you want. And they have pretty much everything. It was everything I could do not to go hog wild and make the most expensive burger known to man, so I went with a spicy buffalo theme. I ordered the buffalo (delicious cow like animal) and got jalapenos and pepper jack, the fried zuccini, and a chocolate banana shake (not on the menu, but they made it anyway). The wife had salmon. I was in burger heaven. I mean, it was really one of the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life. The wife wasn't enjoying her salmon and so she wasn't too pleased. She was happier when I gave her the rest of my shake though (cause it was soooo good). Anyway, one little detail that I thought was awesome was that when my jalapenos came, there were picked ones and fresh ones. And they had ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce at every table. So, in the end, the waitress was kind of a bitch, but this random other dude kept helping us out, so we left her a little tiny tip and gave the random dude some gambling chips, and we were off. Excellent place, come with the guys.",3

From the moment he was admitted to the ER, then subsequently transferred to the hospitals Critical Care Unit on the 2nd floor he received nothing but the best treatment, care and consideration. The doctors and nurses were exceptional. We were even offered a bed to sleep in so that my sybillings and I could stay the night with him. He was admitted 4 more times over the last few months. This was due to failing health. Not due to negligence or early discharge or follow up care. My mother is now in the rehab unit because she had to have a knee replacement. Yet again we had the pleasure of the staff and same treatment my father received. I would hightly recommend Spring Valley Hospital. Also while talking with other professionals about Spring Valley Hospital all noted that the staff is very happy there and many have often spent many years employed by the hospital. It is also a very clean hospital.",4

My husband and I are constantly watching out for that and it's not that we do not eat sugar, but most of the time we save it for a special time, this was not one of them. What we saw did look inviting and very worth a return trip, on a day when sugar doesn't matter.

43746,"We were so looking forward to trying Herks, but unfortunately, had a not-so-great experience... we live a mile or two from the restaurant and thought delivery would be quick. I ordered a pizza at 7pm and was told it would be an hour. Considering it was a Friday evening, we were fine with that. By 8:30, I called the restaurant and was told that our pizza was not there, so the driver must be on his way. 9:00pm, still no pizza... by this point, we were over it and just didn't want the driver to show up expecting to be paid, so I called again and was told they lost the order. The guy on the phone apologized and offered to send a free pizza immediately, so I once again gave them our order. 9:30, the driver shows up and hands the pizza to us and apologized. We weren't mad and totally understand that mistakes happen, but were pretty annoyed when we opened the box and saw they gave us a smaller pizza than we ordered. Seriously? Whatever, it was free... 2 hours late, but free (minus a tip for the driver). The pizza was ok, but again, not what we ordered and it took 2.5hrs to get it.

The fact that our waitress only came to our table once to get our drink order and never came back. Had to wave down another waitress to get our food ordered. Once we got our appetizers it was bland n cold, their Nigiri's dry, the rolls were off tasting as if they over cooked the eel sauce & the baked rolls just awful had to return them because it was burnt. Who serves anything burnt?? Didn't have an appetite for anything they had after that. It was honestly a waste of time & money. Had to eat somewhere else.",0

34663,"ended up at The Chanter for one of my work colleague's leaving night. on arrival we wandered in and found a massive area that had been reserved for our party, so big thumbs up that there was a place to sit for everyone that came :) i know i'm not old, but i am old enough to appreciate a seat in a pub!! once the first round of drinks was ordered, we also put in a food order for a light dinner. the menu is vaguely similar to wetherspoons bars and the like so basic pub grub with an emphasis on fried food and burgers. nothing to complain about though as it was good value and from the food i tried it was tasty as well. just what you need to help soak up drinks on a work night out! also the drinks were well priced, with a bottle of white being only about \u00a311 and they also offer a student discount if you're lucky enough to have one of those handy student cards! on top of drinks, loads of seats, and decent pub grub this place plays good music and draws in a varied crowd of people! we happened to be there the friday night before the Scotland v France rugby match so had an abundance of french men about wanting a drink and chat. i have to say that i really enjoyed my night and that this place is definitely A-OK. maybe not the most glamourous of venue, but more than acceptable for a good night out with the work colleagues.",2

2441,"One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar. So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday. Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \""good old days\"" category. Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old. Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday! However, for a $15 price tag. But! You also get a cowboy hat. I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free. The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people. It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food). As for the rest of the food....it is okay. The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons). I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread. For the meal, I had the \""catch of the day\"" which was ahi tuna. It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink. I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak. The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table. I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side. But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience. It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience. There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well. There is also a big cow that greets you at the entrance. Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? Probably not. But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.",3
49228,"This newly opened restaurant came to our attention through Yelp and we are glad it did. Great service, delicious food, and large portions helped justify the slightly inflated prices. The draft and bottle list had ~30 different varieties and the wine seemed reasonably priced. Along with your normal expectations for an Italian restaurant (salad and bread with your meal), Gabriella's also included cheese, olive, and pepper plate. Our entrees were quite large and we were told the desserts are all homemade (we were too full to try them). This place is worth your time and money.",3
3879,"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast \""elites\"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) Why they let me play, I'll never know:) Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:) It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a \""Rodgering\"":) So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:) Where to start...I know...the parking lot:) When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:) After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than \""regal\"" atmosphere:) They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:) The smell in S&J can only be described as \""extreme humanity\""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-) S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on \""tap\"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or \""boofay\"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group. It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:) S&J provided a table full of taco \""fixin's\""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-( They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground \""creature\""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called. I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, \""beef\""...just not very good \""beef\"":( The hot tray holding the \""meat\"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of \""meat\"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:( But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco. I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:( I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:( One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not \""broiled\""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:) Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:( Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:) Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning). They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)",0

Sad to say watching the customers was more amusing than watching the girls. Not only were they not cute, but their dancing was WACK. the dj played pretty good music tho. Drinks were weak. I left without a lap dance. Need I say more?",1
20986,first off i am not a fan of this place at all. There are various places in charlotte with the same set up doing it way better. The onion rings where not what i expected greasy and lacking in flavor. My burger was sub par but i did enjoy my milkshake. Maybe it was just a bad day but it didn't win me over enough to ever come back.,2
10424,"This is the only buffet in NYNY. It's only for breakfast and something of an odd combination. For starters it was $30 for two, not bad for a Vegas buffet. That is until you see the offerings. Strange pairings of eggs so firm they were more sliced than scooped, with BBQ pork loin for breakfast? There were unusual items like pot-stickers and egg -fu-yung on the breakfast buffet. The strange and small assortment of items left us not wanting to return, and we didn't. The 2 stars instead of 1 star was solely because the staff kept our cups full.",1

40508,"So I went to this restaurant last night with 3 of my friends hoping to have a good time. Sadly going to this place was not a very pleasant experience. First thing I noticed was that the table the waitress seated us at was cracked and held together by scotch tape. When asked to be moved to another seat, she rudely told us no. So we sat down anyways and after waiting a very long time for our orders to come, the plates that we were served on were cracked and chipping away. I didn't ask for pieces of porcelain with my meal but the waitress apparently taught I needed the extra vitamins. The food was half decent, and if you like your food seasoned with half a pound of salt, this place is for you. Also a word of warning, bring a pack of tums with you if your going to this restaurant, it'll help a lot trust me. Taking the rude waitresses, broken tables, pieces of porcelain in my food, and having it served with enough salt to kill a large elephant; I'm giving Kan Bai a 2/10 would not eat there again.",0

15910,The food is absolutely spectacular. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. The only reason I leave off one star is because some of the waitresses aren't spectacular. I also get very annoyed with picking up food. The hostess will tell me 15 minutes and it will take longer than 30. I even leave late expecting the long wait and will still have to sit around for a few minutes for it. Every once in a while they forget the miso soup too.,3
18393,"this review is for the \""Ultimate Detail\"" which is suppose to include a full interior cleaning, clay bar treatment, buff and wax and engine cleaning. Per their website, you can add on an oil change or engine cleaning for $25. My friend bought me the detail as a thank you for letting her bf and her stay at my house for a few months while their foreclosure house they bought was in a long drawn-out escrow. I pull up to the service area for my 9:30am appt. and they had no idea I was coming. Now mind you, it takes 3 weeks during snowbird season to schedule a detail so I am surprised that they are not prepared for the time it takes to do my Ford F-150 . I encounter the service writer first and she tries to tell that the engine detail is not included, I inform her that it is, she insists it is not. We do this for 5-10 minutes and she finally asks someone and then bam-it is suddenly included! Bait and Switch? Who knows... I also have to point out to her that the truck's factory intake has been replaced with a performance intake and they must be cautious when doing the engine cleaning. She has no idea WTH I am talking about so I ask to see the Detail Manager. He comes out after another 5 minutes, I show him the intake and ask that a bag be placed over the intake and care taken when the engine cleaning gets done. He agrees and then assures me 'I am personally going to make sure this is taken care of perfectly ' referring to the entire detail. He can see that to this point I am not impressed with how this is starting off so he tries to reassure me and I can appreciate that. IF ONLY IT WAS TRUE! I finish with him and tell the girl to add on the wheel detail as I have been out in the dunes a few times since October. Per website it is suppose to be $25. I get to cashier and hand her my ticket , She says \""$40 please\"". I am like WTF! I have a prepaid detail certificate and the add-on is $25. She calls the Assistant Manager Mike over and he apologizes and steps away to the manager's office go correct it within the computer system. He come back, apologizes and reassures me the truck is going to look great.Bait and Switch again?!?!? I leave and get a call at around 2:45 that the truck is done. I get back to Classic at around 4:45 pm, just i time to see them moving the truck out from under the detail area. I stop the guy midway through and have him just pull over. I notice right away wheels wells are full of sandy grit. Oh boy, my worst fears are coming true, a half-ass job. There is tar on running boards, dust on fender flares. I run my hand along the paint on the hood and also the bed and feel the grit is still adhering to the paint when it should be smooth like glass. This means they did not do the clay bar treatment at all nor did they polish because that too would remove the grit. I am fuming and thankfully speak spanish. I chew the guy a new one about the various things and he is flabbergasted and does not know what to say. He says talk to his manager. I ask about the engine being clean and he looks at me dumbfounded and tells me he does not if it was done. We pop the hood and thankfully it was done. I was so mad I decide to wait until the next day for Mike to return as he seemed to be the only one who has a sense of urgency and sincerity for customer service. I go home and really begin looking at the truck even more and find so many more flaws that I am again beyond annoyed. ex: I wiped my fingers in the pockets of the doors and the dust coats my fingers. Essentially , I have surmised that what they did was give me their Ultimate Wash not their Ultimate Detail and even that was done poorly. I return the next day and show Mike all the issues, he is very apologetic and immediately agrees to redo my detail. I plan on rescheduling sometime next week and will post an update. So, if you go for a detail there some advice: 1) If you pay for the higher end detail that has clay bar treatment, check the paint with your bare hand. It should feel like clean glass. If you feel grains of dirt, they did not clay bar it. 2) they may sell you the same services at different prices or charge you for services that should have been included. Buyer beware. As others have noted,the service is just not the same here anymore and it saddens me to see a highly respected business turn into a mediocre one so quickly. No one to blame but managers not holding employees to a certain standard of professionalism and pride. Sad to see it happen once again to a favorite business.",1
48905,"Yum, yum, yum! Will try not to repeat other diners reviews so here goes: Loved the burgers. Juicy, well cooked and good quality, home made burgers. Loved the chips. Partly skin on, yummy, perfectly cooked, crispy where it counts and fluffy inside. Fab gluten free buns (burger gf) - looks like brioche buns but held together really well and really impressed they do gf buns too! Great ice cream - maple syrup and walnut home made on the premises. \u00a31,75 for a decent sized scoop in a tub with toppings at 50p each. Yummy as were the toppings: honeycomb and I also asked for peanut butter. Proper US peanut butter. Toilets - lovely and clean. Always a good point. So, burger, chips, coke, ice cream and toppings, about \u00a312.50. Went home in food coma and raved about the gf greatness of the burgers. Staff friendly and left us to chat.

44997,"Loud Hip Hop, salty margaritas and a nice variety of tacos. Ma\u00efs is definitely a unique experience. There was a long wait for a table (they don`t take reservations) but the host gave us the option of passing on a cell phone number which he would call when a spot was free. This was great as it was very very cold outside and the place is tiny so waiting-in wasn't an option. We headed down the street for a drink and ended up missing the call - making our wait a bit longer when we called to check. The owner was GREAT about this - he brought us a round of tequila shots because we waited for a table for over an hour but honestly it was mostly our fault. My margarita was awesome and authentic and had fresh coriander. Sorry what?! FRESH CORIANDER. So I was pretty happy about that. I had two. The tacos were good. Nothing to write home about.....reasonably priced and unique flavors. My favorites were the carnitas and the squash, black bean and fresh cheese. The crunchiness of the pork rinds on the carnitas was a really nice touch, and who doesn't like fresh cheese? All in all, I enjoyed the drinks and the vibe (young, loud, dark, intimate) of this place more-so than the food but I will definitely be returning to see what other taco flavor combinations they come up with",3

92,"After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood. So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good. Once we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer. The waitress handed it to the hostess. I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit. Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it. In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong. Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do. Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with. I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly. Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price. Mom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty. I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich. We left with full and happy tummies. To comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place. But I expected that and find it part of the charm. The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room. Overall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich. I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.",1

Just for the record, we went there about a year prior to this service call for new brakes and spent about $400. The team back then was completely different and had great customer service which is why we went back in the first place. Don't go there.",0

We made our way down a narrow passage way into the table area. The decor is blah with bad lighting and none of the empty tables had been wiped off. While waiting for our food, I went to the restroom, which clearly had not been recently cleaned and a huge cylinder of toilet paper was set on top of the empty dispenser. Our food arrived and the person in charge of the kitchen must have been friends with the decorator -- blah.

21049,"Good Idea: Tix4Tonight for cheap tickets for shows and buffets. Bad Idea: Having an outdoor Tix4Tonight booth on the strip mid summer at a record 118 Degrees weather day in Las Vegas. I enjoyed my first Tix4Tonight experience. It's way better than Groupon. That's another story I don't want to get in to, because Groupon customer service sucks. It was like trying to convince an Apple user that owns every Apple product to switch to Andriod. Like talking to a idiot and asking them to give up their baby. Not gonna happen. If you use Groupon consider your money lost and you we scammed and hope for the best. Customer Service will not help with issues. However, T4T you will get a better experience. I like the fact that multiple staff member passed out water to keep us semi-cool under umbrellas in the Vegas death heat. Also, nice that a person gives you the 411 on tickets when you enter the line, so you don't get to the front and find out your tickets are sold out. My only gripe is I feel the prices can be lower. This is Vegas there are a lot of free shows and comps everywhere! Also buy-one-get-one free is very common, just not at T4T. This place is a business making bank off of tourist. If you are lazy, this place is fine, but if you ask around or have hook ups in Vegas this place is a waste of time and money. I do recommend you check out T4T, because I had a great experience. I saved money but I wasn't blown away by the savings. And I was offered other shows besides the one I was interested. Think of this place as a low budget travel agent, but not as pushy as a timeshare salesman. That reminds me! Don't fall for timeshares in Vegas. Buy your tickets. You'll thank me later.

13135,"We stayed at the Luxor for 4 nights. The hotel is located slightly away from the center of the strip but thought it was still in a great location. We were in the pyramid portion of the hotel - our room was a Pyramid Deluxe which was a nice size. Then again, we also only had one king instead of 2 queen beds. The bed was really comfortable too!! In addition to the bed there were 2 night stands, vanity, circular table with two chairs, an over-sized chair, TV with armoire and high speed internet connections (not wifi). The room was clean, bathroom had a big shower as well as lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a hair dryer. For those that need it, there was a ironing board and iron. We wish a mini fridge and microwave came standard but other than that, we thought the room was great. The room also had adjustable ac/heat so that was real nice. FYI: Upon check-in, the room we had requested in advance w/ a king was not available so we had to check back the next day (we arrived at about 7pm Monday). They were able to accomodate us to what had been requested, just had to be patient . We requested a bell man to come and assist with the move of our baggage, which worked out perfectly because he knew exactly where the room was and what elevator to take. Unfortunately, we did not find the food all that great in the hotel. Starbucks only goes so far *lol* The swimming pools were refreshing, hot tub was hot. All in all, we didn't find the Luxor as bad as we had read in other reviews (on TripAdvisor) so that was a pleasant surprise as I was nervous until we saw first hand. Did not spend much time in the Casino portion but found the filtering out of cigarette smoke pretty good. The individuals trying to get people to sign up for timeshares w/ the ploy of free shows got old but after a day or so they stopped pestering us. Check out was easy, many options but we checked out via the TV. Great idea.",2

13938,"How did I miss reviewing The Hotel after our Vegas trip? The reasons many people book The Hotel (the rooftop bar, the connection to Mandalay Bay with its beach and many pools), was not really our reason. We just wanted a nice hotel, at a good price. The Hotel surely delivered. First of all, the room was huge. We had a sitting area, with a TV, huge bedroom with many closets, another TV, and bathroom about the size of the bedroom, also with a TV, separate stalls, and double sinks. I think the entire suite was larger than a typical Boston or NYC apartment. If Vegas did not have so many slot machines, we really could have spent a lot of time in the room. And, it was very clean. And I love all their spa products. Mini bar was expensive, and be careful to not use it for your own drinks, they charge you if you do! We had a misunderstanding about this.. but thankfully a quick phone call and they reversed the charge. The location is at the top of the strip- so it can be a hike to the other casinos. But, there are plenty of walkways through each of the casinos, and lots of slot machines, to make the journey fun. The Hotel is directly connected to Mandalay Bay, which has a ton of restaurants, shops, and again, more slot machines. Definitely stop at House of Blues - great happy hour, and fun atmosphere. The Hotel is also close the airport, so I think also makes for a cheaper cab ride compared to some of the hotels. Will definitely be on my 'return to' list.",3
42814,"Personally, I would give this place 3 stars for food, 5 stars for being a fun place to hang out with friends. First the food. We got the house brat, a pretzel, some Belgian fries, a vegan burger, a couple of beers, and another pretzel with nutella for dessert. Everything was decent but not life-changing. Prices were a little bit on the high side. There was a decent (but not huge) imported beer selection. One plus was that they have a wide variety of sauces, mustards, and ketchups which are interesting and fun to try with the pretzels and fries. One a side note, this is a vaguely German-inspired pub, not a place for authentic traditional German food. However, if you are looking for a fun place to hang out with friends, then this place is perfect. They have a huge outdoor patio area with a bunch of games to play (extra-large Jenga, ping-pong, etc.). Most importantly, we weren't pressured to keep ordering. My wife and I got our food and one drink each, ate, then spent an hour nursing our beers and playing Jenga and the waitstaff never made us feel uncomfortable about it.",2

She had a meeting for her work and she got a room for a couple of nights at the Embassy Suites in North Phoenix. \""Sure why not?\"" I said as I got out my many pieces of luggage and started tossing my cleanest dirtiest clothes into my bag. Hours later we arrived to a nice looking hotel, nothing too great nothing too horrible. It wasn't exactly the most welcoming place - but it will do. The gigantic pool looked sooo good! I couldn't wait to swim! We entered our room and saw a cute lil living room with adjacant dining/bar area. That came with a good sized fridge - empty unfortunatly... but still a good size and I was happy to see it also had a freezer. There was a nice bathroom with one of those shower heads that have different settings and of course the bed room. I LOVED the bedsheets! I literally laid in them all day and night! You couldn't rip me from them! The bed itself was nice and comfy and I really appreciated the long clyndar of a pillow! The pool was a huge circle in the ground. I don't mean for that to sound bad - but that's really what it was. I still had fun swimming around in it anyway. I did love the free breakfast they had in the mornings. They made it sound like it was a continential breakfast which means cut up fruit and aging danishes... but to my surprise they had a nice spread. They had eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit juices, danishes, muffins - the whole nine! Including a freshmade omlette station! It was a lot of fun grabbing my lil bowl and fillin it different fillers for a cook to make into an omlette for urs truely! :) It was a nice stay, not a grand get away... but it was something different and I'm glad I chose to go.",2
32551,Solid 4 stars for the food itself. Service was a little lacking though. The brunch menu was delightful. I ordered the grilled cheese and it was made from Tillamook Cheese!!! I'd recognize that taste anywhere. Took me back to the grilled cheese sandwiches I used to make myself when I was growing up on the West Coast. Will probably be back to try other items on the menu.,3
1106,"Steer clear if you care about your body, enter if you are looking for a tasty way to shave precious years of your life. What they have done is basically take a simple New York style Deli concept and made it appealing to the local Phoenix crowd. The thing is, when I was living in NYC, I could afford to eat meals like this because without a car I walked an average of 3-5 miles per day. There is simply no excuse for this type of excess in a driving city like Phoenix. You'll spend 2 hours at the gym to burn off lunch here. My prediction is that 50 years from now, when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks, the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos: it seemed like a good idea at the time, but boy was it a killer.",2
13560,"Some cool cat hanging outside of the doors at Caesar's Palace handed me a pass Sunday night and told me that I could get into this club without paying a cover charge. Sure, I'll save the $20. I was already down from a terrible run at the craps table. Crap! Just like what I would expect in Vegas...a decent sized dance floor, surrounding VIP sections and beautiful people all over the place. I never go out on Sundays but being in the city that never sleeps I was playing with house time. I was definitely digging the music here. The DJ was playing an awesome mix of hip hop and Top 40 hits. Needless to say, I was gettin' it on the dance floor. I paid $8 for each Coors Light bottle. A little steep if you ask me but I suppose that is the norm in LV. Good thing that I am a lightweight because this place becomes more fun when the beer vision kicks in. Just saw a few reviews that said this place has dance floors on different levels. Wish someone told me because I was a one man wolf pack for the night and would have enjoyed checking out the different scenes here. Guess I'll be back here when I'm visiting Sin City again because this place is pure fun.",3
44495,"We ventured out to this great place and we weren't disappointed. The Backyard burger will become a tradition for my Vegas visits. The Biloxi chicken sandwich and steak salad are also very very good. Service was polite and professional and though we had a trainee for our meal, everything went well. I'd recommend this place to anyone for a reasonably priced well prepared meal.",4
49240,"When this place first opened, I was excited to have a revolving sushi place so close to my work. Revolving sushi is usually inexpensive, and makes for a good lunch to break up the monotony of the work week. We didn't have a chance to check it out until this weekend, and I don't think I'll be going back. I guess the whole revolving thing bombed for them, so they went to an all-you-can-eat menu. Good in theory, but in practice, it left much to be desired. It's $11.95 a person, and the menu has everything from various appetisers (gyozas, yakitori, edamame, etc) to soups, fried rice and udon entrees, to sushi. I just wasn't impressed with anything, really. Our server was nice, but the food just wasn't worth it. We got tempura shrimp, and stir-fried seafood udon to start. The tempura was ok, but nothing special, but the udon was squishy, and lacking flavour. For sushi, we got the eel and avocado roll, the spicy yellowtail and the shrimp tempura roll. None of it was anything to write home about. I've had better. Way better. I guess for $28 the amount of food we got was ok, but when I really had to choke it down, it just wasn't worth it.",1
20585,The service is awful but besides that the owner has a very smart mouth on him and is very rude. If you show any concern he seems to want to punish you and say your order wi take 1 hour and make u wait. He is very inconsiderate and literally a smart mouth. He charges extra on the bill so make sure you check your biil. Food is nothing to brag about. And with his attitude not worth it all.,0

We moved from San Diego to Las Vegas Easter Weekend and honestly I was way too tired after driving all that way (having had to go through and downsize quite a bit day 2 of the move so I selected Umbrella Movers on the site. They were prompt, very nice and well mannered. They did such a great job and it was so reasonable. They are insurance verified and I was super happy to have made this choice.",4
49462,"Had a late dinner Saturday with my boyfriend. As the restaurant was closing we saw a band setting up. Ask our server about what was going on. He explained Late Night. Must admit I was interested. Noticed how the dining room cleared out. And as we sat there for another hour or so and ordered a glass of wine, we talked about how the place was empty. Sitting there my boyfriend and I agreed that dinner was great, the band was good. But to make a special trip in for music at a steak house, is not something either of us would do. Felt odd sitting in a dining room listing to a band. Final thought, dinner and price was well worth the evening. Will be back. Entertainment Late Night at a steak house not for me.",4
30298,"Don't go here! My wife and I bought gift certificates for our mothers to go here as a thank you gift for setting up our wedding shower. Unfortunately they were very busy after the wedding working to pay for everything so they couldn't make it to the spa before the gift certificates expired after six months. I realize this is a long time, but the spa still accepted our money, so they should return a service. The moms finally tried to set up an appointment and called to see if they would still honor the gift certificates even though they had expired, knowing they would probably be spending additional money on things beyond what was covered by the $15. Apparently the spa decided they were going to keep our money and not return a service and just said \""sorry, those are expired\"". So, I can't even review their services because they chose the path of greed over friendly service.",0
42711,"Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates.",3
37093,"Extremely disappointing, fails in execution and seasoning. Duck Pot Pie: featured unevenly chopped vegetables of large and small chunks, resulting in uneven cooking. Nearly raw potatoes will ruin anything. Nearly raw unpeeled potatoes with rough skins, many eyes, and gray areas under the skin are doubly unappetizing. The filling languished in a thin broth and was indifferently seasoned. The biscuit on top was wonderful though. Meat Plate: venison sausage somehow managed to be tough and bone dry yet incredibly greasy. Too much fat in the head cheese, although the olive relish would have provided a nice counterpoint to a good head cheese. Mediocre terrine, on the sweet side. Spinach salad with caramelized apple and pickled onion, andouille and sherry vinaigrette: Very good flavor combination, brought low by rubbery sausage and spinach leaves that were approximately 5 square inches large. Decor: perhaps if the food was good I would stop complaining long enough to care.",0
33789,"Remedy's is one of those neighborhood bars with gambling that Vegas has so many of. Let's do this review in a pros & cons style based on 2 years of giving them our business. Pros: Easy interstate access off I-515 or as some call it the 95. Ample parking. Nice building on the outside. Dark but nice on the inside. Plenty of HDTV's around the bar and strategically placed so you can watch pretty much anything that's on at the time. Separate, glassed off non-smoking area if you want to eat without the smoke. Drinks: strong pours by knowledgeable bartenders who know their stuff. Food: from fish & chips to nachos they have a pretty nice range of offerings with something for almost everyone. And their sliders have been real kid pleasers around here. THEY OFFER TAKEOUT WITHOUT ATTITUDE. Just walk in, go to the back of the bar and find a bartender and you'll have nicely wrapped bags of food in no time. Oh and if they say 15 minutes, they mean 15. I like their consistency. Cons: Service can sometimes be slow. Sometimes...but it's rare. Food: I've had the occasional problem like soggy sweet potato fries, or cold onion rings, and I've had maybe 2 orders out of 50+ that had issues where I sent it back or complained. Again, 2 out of 50+. I did find a strand of hair on my sweet potato fries once. On a bright day adjusting to how dark the place is can be a little rough. But it's a bar, so I really shouldn't say anything about it but I did anyway. Again, I'm looking back over 2 years plus now as I write this and my family keeps asking for their food, and we keep going back. 4 Stars. YMMV but for us Remedy's will be staying on our fail-safe food options list.",3
12448,"I stayed here one night with a friend recently during the March Madness festivities. The location on the strip is great and overall is a nice hotel. The walk to the elevator and then to our room was a bit of a trek, but not too bad. I'm not sure what my friend paid or booked, but it was a double bed room and had a nice separate shower/ bath tub combo. The view was the backside of the strip so not much to look at. I had wanted to go to the pool the first day we were there but we had to wait until noon for it to open which was annoying. We waited in the bar outside the elevates and they had $9 mimosa & Bloody Mary specials so not all was lost. We ended up just doing a lap around the pool deck and not staying as the pool was nothing special. My biggest complaint was that the helpful old security guard gave me unsolicited directions which ended up having me walk an extra mile through the Bally's construction zone just trying to get back to the strip after he told me about \""a great short cut\"". Never again Wyatt, never again...",2
12682,"While on an extended stay at the Palazzo we decided to try Delmonico. I made a reservation through Open Table. We were seated promptly but at a table that was less than desirable where the waiter had to stand behind me while serving us. He was quite pushy and brusque. My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter. If you want a good meal while at the Venetian / Palazzo go to Bouchon where you'll be treated well and the food is great. Just to be balanced I will say that the rib eye that I had was good.",1
37653,"OMG THE ABSOLUTE BEST! If you're ever in Vegas and on the strip, stop by Cosmo and GO TO HOLSTEINS. Our waitress was impeccable and the best. I wish I'd gotten her name because she deserves a raise!! Best customer service ever! PROS: -burgers were cooked to absolute perfection and to the way we wanted. -shakes were to die for. foodgasm to the max. -fries were crispy and perfect. Overall, it was one of the best hamburgers I'd ever tasted and the best experience all in one. No doubt whenever I'm in Vegas I will make a stop at Holsteins!",4

The staff in the front are very attractive. for the guys, sit in the front or the bar! the flavor of the food itself has always pleased my tongue. the yam fries sometimes come out a bit soggy. and the price of the burgers is a bit high for what you can find elsewhere, but heck you're at the cosmopolitan casino, nothing is cheap there. i want to give this place a 4.5 or 4.75 stars.",4

I'm not sure if it was me,. or if I have just been to so many buffets, but this buffet was BLEHHH?! The good thing about the buffet is we decided to purchase the $35 all day pass which covered food for the day. YES THAT IS IT! The food that was provided was toOo original,.. I had the typical omelet ( two thumbs up for the omelet bar in the morning, the man who made my omelet did a great job!), bacon, sausages, hash browns, french toast for brunch. The best part of brunch was the all you can drink champagne :) Dinner was a basic meal that included rice, some type of fish and some veggies,.. they also had a pasta bar which was pretty awesome, also a section for chinese food and a section for dessert. But there was nothing about dinner that stood out; I wish they had crab legs or something errr,.. or even a wider variety of seafood? This place reminded me of my college dining hall, esp the food that was served x_X Also, the bus boys/ladies,. just came around once to take our drink orders and never came back to refill our drinks nor pick up our dirty dishes. If you're looking for some good service,. this \""dining hall\"" isn't for you!",2

The morning that my family was leaving Vegas we decided we should go to a cheap breakfast buffet, after a quick search we learned that Terrible's had a brunch buffet for only $10 a person. IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Everything was horrible. The french toast was stale, the eggs were cold, the OJ was SOUR. My muffin was so hard that when I threw it at my sister it actually hurt her when it finally hit. It's breakfast people! It's not that hard to get it right! the only thing my mom and I ate was the watermelon. $10 for watermelon? not such a great deal. it really was TERRIBLE. I would have given negative stars if possible.",0

Happy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie). When we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!,4

Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!",4
21647,"If you have ever been to Katz's in NYC, Kaufman's in Chicago or Cantor's in LA you need to know right away , you will be disappointed ..this isn't that kind of Jewish Deli. Now if you haven't, this might be just fine for you. Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas: Refill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint... give us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount .... When you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness. Do something about the fries...when the person next to you says , \""they taste okay when you put gravy on them\"" you know they are just meh... If you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult. Check on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses. Chompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?",2
5846,"It looks like a lot of people are split on Tom's. Now lets get the obvious out of the way. It is the Southside people, plus this is a late night diner, plus this is the SOUTHSIDE. The diner is not in the greatest of conditions but the booths are big enough to seat a group of 6 which is great at 2am. Be nice and your food will come out faster, at like a hooligan and you will probably be waiting a little longer. But in general the food normally comes out pretty fast Now, to the food. A couple things. Stick to the breakfast, because it is good and nothing beats a good breakfast spot after a night at the bars. The pancakes and breakfast sandwiches are my favorite. Second, I really thing they have a good late night gyro. Don't ask why out of all the places in the Southside that I choose Tom's to get a Gyro, but they have an XTRA Large Gyro. The moment I saw that on the menu, I just could not resist. The end of result: I was good because it was a very large gyro, but the quality of meat was not of Mike and Tony's. But I did not expect it to be great because it was so large and that was enough to satiate me at the time. Overall, Tom's is your spot for a some good food and a place to go over the bad decisions you may have made earlier in the night.",2
23666,"Hands-down the best and most fresh vegetables and teriyaki bowls in town! I love this place. I used to go to samurai Sam's but the one near my work closed at random. That obviously didn't make me too happy but after trying Terryaki Madness I wasn't sad for long. I love that you can customize your bowl and they have a variety of different options including some Hawaiian dishes. It's always clean and smells good in the restaurant in the bathrooms believe it or not look great. That's a very important thing! What that tells me is that they do not only pay great attention to their food, but they also pay a lot of attention to the ancillary things that other restaurants let go. After the gym this is a protein in carb pack power lunch. Great for energy and increasing your metabolism! I highly recommend it especially for health goers. The only thing that I would try to find out is do they sell organic? Is there food non-GMO? That's important for me so I hope I get the answers I'm looking for. Terryaki Madness has a variety of locations across the city. And they were voted the best of Las Vegas. Check them out! I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",3

So, Crazy Dog Mom wins! ;) They were able to get him in at extremely short notice, did an incredible job and even a slightly modified Schnauzer cut, and the price was fantastic. $40 for the groom with a $5 off coupon, but even at $45, I'll be taking him back from now on. :)",4

I had looked at the menu online and read other reviews and I was all set to get something more on the healthy side. When Ashley came to take my order, I opened my mouth and out came, \""Didn't I read that you had some kind of Elvis breakfast?\"" Folks, don't be confused like I was. There it is, hiding in the sandwiches and not under the breakfast section of the menu. Ashley showed me where it was and that's what I ordered. Peanut butter is healthy, no? Breakfast consisted of two slices of French toast with bananas, bacon, peanut butter, and Nutella inside--something from each of the five food groups so I deemed it healthy! Before ordering, I was brought a very large cup of coffee. You almost need to use both hands to pick it up and it was refilled quickly when I needed the push to be able to do stupid things faster. My breakfast was brought and it was delicious! I think Elvis would be pleased that he's being remembered with some good food like this. All the staff at MTO was outstanding. One of the bus persons asked me how my breakfast was as he removed my plate. When I said, \""Excellent,\"" he replied with a, \""That's what we like to hear,\"" and a big smile. I chatted with another staff member about restaurants in Los Angeles and he gave me a tip about a place to go in San Gabriel. I have to come back and get the pancakes with carrots and coconut. It looks too good not to try!",4
21872,"Lame place. I was staying at the Monte Carlo, the hotel it's connected to, and so my friend was inside. I was going over to just make sure she was OK since it was 1:45 am and Vegas tends to get a lot of drunk, horny guys around that time and I just wanted to just have a drink with her. I had had drinks here before so it was no big deal but the door man at their inside entrance told me I had to go to the front entrance which was outside. No big deal so I went around. The bouncer outside said they were closed and wouldn't even allow me in to look for my friend. I even asked if he would hold onto my Drivers license but the douche bag wanted my phone instead. Since there was no way I was going to give him my Galaxy S3 to hold onto he said \""then you ain't gettin' in so leave\"". Rude attitude of a NY city club but at some dive bar in Vegas. Like I stated before I had been there prior to this, the service was poor, the establishment smelled like mold, and it was like the bar in the movie \""From Dusk till Dawn\"". I honestly will never go back based on the way they treat people who are staying at the hotel their establishment is connected to and seeing that you can easily take a tram to go to the Aria or Bellagio there are far better options. NEVER GOING BACK HERE.",0

I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad (I think) which was really good and my boyfriend order a hawaiian pizza with sausage and jalape\u00f1os. We both enjoyed our food very much. The strange thing was the service. It was kind of on the bad side. There were probably 4 groups outside (including us) and 2 inside, so it wasn't very busy. And we waited a long time to get our waters, get our food, refills, and our bill at the end, we became impatient and got up and handed our waiter the bill as we were leaving. Eh. They were nice, but slow. Luckily the food tasted good.",2

The ambience can use a little improvement. Perhaps, it needs a little fresh touch of modern comtemporary decors to \""mix\"" it up a little. Let's talk food...I am more of the desert-type of crepes, so I enjoyed the Nutella Crepe (Yummiest!). The Lemon sugar crepe is also be craved for. I am yet to try the fondu...but it's the top on my list to try, next visit. I had tried other main-dish crepes (for dinner and lunch), in which they are all good with a nice twist. I recomended Salmon (I know!) crepe - don't let the \""salmon\"" fools you. It's worth trying...and for some people, it's rather addicting.

44820,"There's a reason why this Pho place closes early compared to most places. Simply put, like your dad or mom have probably have said about your exs, you could do so much better. I went here with my fiancee just for a quick lunch. I had the pho tai and she had bun cha. (Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho, Pho being the namesake of the restaurant, you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead, I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there, I can only say probably due to laziness. Competing against other established Pho institutions in Chinatown is rough but at least bring your full game. Just felt like this place needs a lot of improvements in the kitchen work for this place to be at least somewhat approachable again.",1
10945,Love this place! Would give it a 5star if service was a bit better. Usually go here once a month. You can't beat all you can eat sushi for $25. Food quality has always been great. Not once have we had something we didn't like. Usually pretty busy. Always packed for lunch and dinner! It can get a bit noisy with all the people.,3

My two girlfriends and I were on the guest list (our two guy friends bought tickets in advance and got inside before us) and probably had to wait around 25 minutes total to get inside. One thing I really didn't prepare for was the walk up the kinda-janky-yet-very-interesting stairs to get to the EDM floor. My friend wore flats that night and I was pretty jealous about an hour in. There aren't many places to sit if you don't have a table or a cabana, so beware. The dance floor was super tiny, and it eventually was swollen with people two hours into the night. I was lucky I didn't have a drink because I was shoved around and stepped on until I decided to leave. I couldn't handle it anymore, plus my wedges were killing me. I went outside for a much needed drink and waited about 5 minutes to get served. $14 for my Maker's Mark and ginger. It got more and more packed inside and outside as the night went on. W&W killed it, but we could barely see their set because of the massive swells of people. The lights were awesome and the dancers were getting their hawt thang going! The bathrooms were really nice, and they have everything a woman would ever need for sale at the counters. The interior is super high class and beautiful as well as the outside. The pool is so tempting! I wanted to dunk my feet in a few times. I give Marquee Nightclub three stars because when I compared it to my experiences at other Vegas nightclubs, it didn't stand out. I'd definitely come back here again, but maybe next time I'll either bring flats in my bag or come with a crew of girls only to increase our chances of getting invited to a table.",2
43174,"I'm big on customer service and this location was lacking any customer service. I was not greeted when walking up to the counter by the 2 workers behind the counter. One was making drinks and the taking orders at the drive thru. When I was greeted by the drive thru person she said \""we'll be right with you\"" but I stood there for another couple minutes until someone came out from the back and said \""have you been helped?\"" (In a not so enthusiastic voice) when I finally got my drink it was given by the barista who also had no enthusiasm for being there or serving. On top of it all my drink was too sweet. I will not be going back to this location. They could learn a thing or two about service from Starbucks. It also was not busy. There was only one other person who ordered a drink before me (in the store)",0
15543,Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old. Pancakes dense and hard. Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.,0
36272,"Came here for breakfast with my sissy. I ordered their guilt free omelette while she got their killer breakfast skillet. My omelette came with potatoes and a biscuit. The omelette itself was just okay, the eggs were overcooked and dry. The sides were all delicious though. My sister loved her breakfast skillet. We both also loved the bread that came with our dish since it tasted so good with their chocolate sauce. The portions were also very generous. Afterwards, we ordered their fondue set for 2 and it was amazing. Every item was delish. No complaints. I'm just sad that we were too full to order a dessert pizza, so hopefully next time.",3
42357,"I feel badly about the two star review. Really, I do. I wanted to like this place. Really. We were seated at 710 PM. It wasn't until 730 that we were even greeted by our server. I don't blame this on her- but rather on the overall disorganization of the place. The drinks took forever, the first time and each subsequent order. Our appetizer was delicious- buffalo mozzarella with two Italian meats. 5 stars! Our entrees were, overall, pretty good. I had the fried chicken with gnocchi. The others I dined with enjoyed their meals as well. My major disappointment was the menu- only five pasta options at an Italian restaurant. My advice: leave the steak to Capital Grille and make great pasta dishes.",1
24226,"3.5 stars My high school reunion- I changed my mind a week before and decided to go. I didn't realize it was more bar than restaurant. My friend M rode down with me. I tried to tell her what my high school was like, but she had to experience it first hand. We parked and heard country music floating through as drunk people stumbled out. We walked in dressed in, or I should say overdressed in, black cocktail dresses. Everyone else was wearing tank tops and jeans. We were dressed to go to Scottsdale afterwards. My former classmates kept saying \""Why are you ditching us for \""Snotsdale\""? Regardless I was happy to see everyone. After some margaritas, yes we got them salty, I was right back in high school. It was fun catching up with everyone. M. got hit on by Mr. Popular who was a year ahead of our class. I don't even know why he attended our reunion, but his pick up line was classy. \""I've noticed you all night, you're cute. Come here. Do you know who I am?\"" M's reaction, \""Um..... no thanks. I have no idea who you are. I didn't go to this high school.\"" It was relaxed and casual. They had good cheap margaritas. I wouldn't mind going back. I'll be found in tank top and jeans, the token Asian.",2
32839,"I'll go ahead and start off my review with this: hash house has gigantic portions at reasonable prices ($12-$15 per entree). That being said, I think that's where all the \""hype\"" is over here at hash house. My friends and I decided to come here based on all of the great reviews of the place and waited for over an hour on a Friday morning. I was surprised to see so many people at 10am, but I guess a Friday before a long weekend will do that kinda thing. Food-wise, I went ahead and took the advice of many of my fellow yelpers, and got the corned beef hash. Piece of advice for those who don't already know....the hash's are literally gigantic pieces of _____ (whatever meat you may choose) over crispy potatoes/wedges. It is not easily mixable, as the potatoes that are given are also rather large. The hash was good in itself, but definitely not what I was expecting. Another one of my friends got the meatloaf hash which did not look too appetizing because they were just pieces of meatloaf chopped up over those crispy potatoes. The pancakes looked ridiculously large but I did not try them. Overall, it was an interesting experience to try this place, but I felt that there was maybe a little too much hype surrounding this restaurant. Quick Tips: 1) Expect to wait (just like any other popular place in LV) 2) Portions are huge so you can easily split one dish among two people.",2
32575,We stopped in after breakfast for a latte and encountered the proprietor on the phone and trying to take our order as he was talking on the phone. He had a look on his face as if we were inconveniencing him and we felt rushed and unwelcome. As we were leaving we had to say thank you and good bye and as he was reading the newspaper he uttered bye with no eye contact. The coffee was not good and we will not return here. This establishment is geared towards the locals.,0
7617,"No restaurant review should ever have to say, \""Where you start getting into trouble with this place is when the entrees come out.\"" But that's exactly the case here. This food is hot garbage wrapped in tortillas. The fish tacos are nauseating. The incredibly dry meat in the green chilli burrito gave my brother in law food poisoning. The beans taste burnt, and they've apparently decided to season their rice with dust. Failing at the basic, I can only imagine the nightmares happening on the deeper items on the menu. Also it's overpriced. The chips and salsa are very good (especially the green salsa), and the staff is very friendly. Those things are important enough to squeeze out two stars. But if you're near downtown Mesa, I don't know why you wouldn't go to Mango's instead.",1
10984,"On occasion, I take my son to get a happy meal here. He doesn't like fries, so we either get double apple slices, or a yogurt/apple slices. This has never been a problem, until today. The manager has decided that this has to be up charged now. I don't have a problem with an extra dollar and some change. What I have a problem with is how McDonald's is discouraging healthful eating now. For many, that dollar up charge could be a big deal for families on a budget, and could discourage them from having their kids eat more heathy items. Chicken nuggets and burgers have enough fat and sodium, so why force fries down everyone's throat? 90% of people will order it \""as is\"". They should not discourage the other 10%. I personally will not set foot in this establishment again, or go through it's drive-through. I don't know if this is a corporate policy, or the franchises decision. Either way, they need to change this rediculous policy. To top it off, they got my order wrong. Luckily I always double check my order before I leave, since this place gets it wrong 50% of the time. Get it together McDonald's.",0
35119,"One of Edinburgh's best musical venues. I've seen a helluva lot of things in this venue and I never fail to have an excellent time. The sound is brilliant for classical music as well as rock and pop. The stalls are much more comfy these days - I wonder if they've replaced the seats? It feels much more spacious and there's plenty of room for legs, bags, jackets and drinks. The building itself is a mish-mash of old architecture with a modern extension. It's a genuinely loved piece of Edinburgh's make-up. When I hear a gig will be played here I am always pleased - I'm still to have a bad experience here.",4
29819,"After passing by another breakfast place only to find a ton of people waiting for a table, we decided not to wait and head somewhere else. Local Breeze is located on a residential street in what once was a house. We arrived and were seated immediately outside on the patio. I really felt like I was dining in someone's backyard. It was so inviting and relaxing with the bustle of happy diners surrounding us. The brunch menu has many items to choose from, it was hard to decide. Especially after reading about the french toast, but I passed the french toast and opted for some bacon and eggs. Served with country potatoes, homemade bread and jam. It was delicious! We were told that many ingredients are sourced locally. The eggs tasted incredibly fresh and the bacon, was excellent. Cut fairly thick, it was cooked to perfection. The potatoes were yummy as was the homemade bread. Hubby opted for the Bourbon & Cola Cured Ham, White Cheddar Omelet and it was equally delicious. The ham had the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The coffee was also great, nice and strong. Dish after dish that we watched being served looked better than the next, my only regret is that we didn't get to try their other food. Between the atmosphere, service and food, it was a perfect way to end our trip before heading to the airport.",3
33794,"We have been to this location multiple times previously to have my boyfriend's hair cut. Each time we visit is a guessing game as to whether or not he will get a good hair stylist or not. He has been four times and each time their is a different staff and hair stylist available. His previous visit to this review was not good either so it appears we will be looking for a new place to get his hair cut. This last visit was the worst as his hair was butchered beyond immediate correction. I suggest next time my boyfriend really take the time and look his hair over and make sure it is cut the way he requested. That way they can make any changes or corrections to it because once you leave you have accepted the cut even if was done crappy. It was really bad after I examined it later at home, half of the hair was cut uneven with one side longer than the other. I had to take my hair scissors to it later at home and trying to correct a bad cut is hard to do if you are not an experienced hair stylist or barber. OK so he went around looking even more goofy and nerdy for two weeks until it grew out so lesson learned!",1
8004,My husband and I ate here with his parents Saturday. We arrived at 5:45 for a 6:00 dinner reservation. The restaurant was half empty when we placed our order. It took 55 minutes and two requests to our waitress to get our first course. It took another 30 for our main. I complained to the waitress and the general manager. Both were unapologetic stating there was nothing they could do as it was the first night of restaurant week. Restaurant week means a trimmed down menu and I assume is meant to attract new customers. There are too many other great restaurants in the area to give Cowboy Ciao a second chance with such an unapologetic attitude.,1
25680,"Some friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend, and decided to walk around near our hostel to find a place to eat. Less then a ten minute walk away we found Ye Olde Orchard Pub, and it was exactly what we wanted. It was different than most places we would have gone to in America, the food was great and the waiters were so nice. We mentioned it was my friends 19th birthday expecting a piece of cake, and we got a special drink complete with rules and a name I shouldn't mention. The waiter overheard us talking about where to go that night and came right up to us and suggested about five different bars and clubs we should go to, some of which ended up being the best parts of the night. We couldn't resist going back there the next morning and the breakfast was just as good as the dinner. I would recommend it for anyone but especially if you're a group of traveling students like we were its a great place to go. If we ever go to Montreal again it will be first on our list.",4
27831,"This was our second time at this restaurant and both occasions have been very good. We didn't have reservations, but were promptly seated. The service was very friendly and efficient. There is a huge menu and everything we have tried there has been great. It reminds me a lot of The Cheesecake Factory, but I think the quality of food is slightly better. The portions are very large and we never leave hungry. It terrific place for lunch if you're down by the Palazzo or the Wynn.",3

If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut.",4
46301,"Mi figue, mi raisin. Ma premi\u00e8re visite chez Poutine Centrale ne m'a pas renvers\u00e9. La poutine est correcte oui, mais pour un resto qui en fait sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, elle pourrait \u00eatre meilleure. Mes papilles de qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9duites par la sauce qui ne go\u00fbte \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s rien. L'autre probl\u00e8me, est que le service n'est pas tr\u00e8s rapide. Les deux seuls cuisiniers avaient de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande. Pour un Pogo maison et une petite poutine aux l\u00e9gumes, j'ai attendu pas loin de 15 minutes. M\u00eame pour l'heure du diner, ce n'est pas une excuse. Un resto de ce genre se doit d'\u00eatre plus rapide. De plus, lors de ma premi\u00e8re visite ici, l'endroit \u00e9tait emboucan\u00e9, \u00e0 un point tel que les yeux m'en piquait \u00e0 la fin de mon repas. Un probl\u00e8me de ventilation aux cuisines ? Surement. Les points positifs : Les pogos maison sont carr\u00e9ment d\u00e9licieux et croustillants. Je les recommande. Le menu de poutine est tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9 et offre plus d'une vingtaine de choix diff\u00e9rents. On gagne donc \u00e0 revenir et tenter d'autres poutines.

856,"Doesn't look like anything special from the outside and was a bit reluctant to go in, but I'm thrilled I did. Honestly used to go here every weekend when I lived in the area. Perry makes one of the best burgers in town. I think they said they get their meat fresh from the willy st co-op every day. So delicious. Then I'd stay and fill up on relatively cheap drinks and catch the Brewers or Bucks game. They have a ton of tv's along with pool, ping pong, and darts. Perfect place if you want some good food and a place to watch the game.",4
46814,"Paul's Pel'meni specializes in one thing and one thing only: Pel'meni. Pel'meni is a sort of Tortellini mixed with dumplings, then covered in yellow curry, cilantro, and sour cream. At Paul's, they serve beef and potato pel'meni. I tried a half size of both flavors, and for someone with a small stomach like me, it was plenty of food for dinner (it doesn't look like it would be enough, but it's really hearty). While both flavors were good, I preferred the beef. It was spicy (as in with spices) and extra flavorful, compared to the potato and I think next time I'll probably get just the beef and set of a mixture of both of them. Also, the price point was awesome. All this goodness for 4.50 for a half. I can't wait to come back after a night on state street. It will be good post night out food.",3
12614,"I love this hotel. I have stayed in several hotels in vegas and the venetian has become my favorite after my stay during this past summer. It was the week of EDC so the hotel was packed full of crazy people but I guess that's what added to the fun of this experience. My boyfriend and I came here with a group of friends not for EDC but just for the fun of vegas. Our room was amazing! We got placed on the 38th floor and I loved how the security personnel checks your key card before you're able to go up the elevators. It made me feel safe in a weird way haha. The first thing I saw when we opened our double doors was a baby grand piano, say whaaaat? Not only was there a giant piano in our living room but we also had a humongous I'd like to say 50-60 inch flat screen in the main room. There was a full dining table that seated 8 and our room came with a fridge, and a wine cooler. For the rooms we had 2 full king-size bedrooms each with walk in closets. Each room also had a 4 person jacuzzi hot tub, a stand up shower that had 2 shower heads with a gigantic bench inside it (I'm guessing it's meant for more than one person? lol) an in suite gym, and a dressing room with mirrors all around. We had 2 full bathrooms and one 1/2 of a bathroom. We had a fantastic view of the strip and the water show. We had some fun watching the people splash around obnoxiously down at TAO's pool party too. The bed's were so comfy that I had a hard time getting out of bed. For the three nights we stayed at the venetian we found the service to be exceptional and by the push of a button we had a bell hop or hotel worker at our door within minutes. Room service was okay, though it's not quite up to par for the price they charge you. The casino's were awesome and I ended up winning $200 the first night woo! The venetian also has a little mall connected to it that's fun to shop. Most major designers (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada etc..) are available for your interest. There is a food court in the mall that kind of sucks but that isn't the venetian's fault. I recommend eating outside the hotel if you want good food. Come on, I mean, you ARE in vegas!! I had an amazing stay at the venetian and our suite felt like home and I definitely did not want to go back to Cali. I will be coming back in December and I can not wait!",4
27557,Best Chicken Pho in town! No joke! Oh and their steak and rice dish is to absolutely die for. The seasoning is perfection. (Drool!) I need to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee if they have it. Then my heart will be sold forever. Love this place!,4
37472,"I agree with the positive reviews of this spa. I had a massage there last week, and it was very clean, and the massage was great. I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back. Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward. My feet were in heaven for over a day! The price was great. I will be back, and bring friends with me.",4
33024,"I love Hungry Howies Pizza. The best part is the crust. They provide a variety of flavors such as ranch, butter cheese, and herb and garlic, three of my favorites. The staff is nice and friendly and my order is always ready by the quoted time. They also usually have deals going on like $8 medium pizzas. I am a definite fan.",4
44269,"I'm a fan. I've been here a few times and more often than not, all the food I get is pretty good, if not great (at least for an AYCE place). Their AYCE menu is fairly large. The dinner price is $26.95 and for kids it's about $13. Most of the nigiri I've tried was good, with standouts being the tuna, super white tuna, sea bream, yellowtail and eel. Other items on their menu that I'm a fan of include their gyoza, the yellowtail lover roll, and crispy rice with spicy tuna. Their oysters and pork belly are decent and worth ordering again. I wasn't a fan of the seared tuna in AJ sauce or the Hawaiian roll. The interior is cool with the long communal tables and benches. It also seems to be easier to get a seat than other AYCE places around town. The times I went I've never had to wait, which is perfect when my patience is running low, I'm hungry, and all I want to do is stuff my face.",3
48999,"We have a sprinkles in Dc and I am not impressed with their cupcakes but after the high roller ride my hubby had a sweet tooth. The shop was packed but not cramped like in DC. There were not many cupcake flavor options maybe 4-5 different ones. My husband got the banana cupcake and thought it was good. I got a vanilla with sprinkles and it wasn't good at all to me. I am giving them a two because we had small talk with the employees and they were really friendly. The shop was also clean and not cramped. There are a few tables inside and outside for customers. Sprinkles is located in a cool looking newly renovated alley area that takes you to other restaurants, shops, and the high roller. Like I said I'm not a fan of Sprinkles but maybe others enjoy their brand.",1
32542,"Their burgers are fantastic, and the service is wonderful. It's an unusual combination making the service staff suspect. I'm not sure what makes them so cheery, and I suspect there's something going on.... They are always smiley, helpful, and bubbly, regardless of how late it is. I suspect this behavior is insincere. The Chandler location is open super-late, although they don't take care of the 24-hour professions like firemen, policemen, or hospital staff, which would've easily given them 5 stars.",3
22050,"Loved it! I was visiting from NYC with a few friends, and we decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, the rolls were original and very creative, and the staff and management were extremely friendly to our table. I personally enjoyed the casual environment- a fun crowd, hip music in the background, espn on their plasma screens, etc. I'm a big sushi fan, and Sake Bomber did not disappoint!",4
29832,"So I finally got around to checking out Crystals and I left feeling like I had just bought a luxury car only to discover a scratch on the way home. That's not to say I could actually afford to buy anything at Crystals beyond a chai latte. But that's for another review. Crystals is the marquee shopping \""experience\"" at CityCenter. You can spot the spiky architecture from a mile away. Inside is just as weird. Lots of abstract art. Even the stairs ooze expensive, probably built from the rarest trees this side of the Amazon. But do you think anyone who would shop here actually cares about the consequence of gratuitous excess? That's the whole point of Crystals! What struck me the most is how empty the place feels. This is probably what the Fashion Show mall should have been before it was packed to the gills with Hot Topic, The Gap and Cinnabon. Crystals is the opposite of that, and any other mall in Las Vegas. There are maybe 25 stores. If you even want to classify this as a mall. It's essentially the same ultra-high end retailers you'd find at other casino mini-malls selling everything from couture to diamonds to watches. Some places I've heard of like Tom Ford and Louis Vuitton, but there are quite a few I had never heard of before. I guess they just want to remind the middle class tourists that they can look but can't touch. At this point, nearly half of the stores aren't even open yet. From what I could gather, there are three levels at Crystals. But level three seems to be just a way to get to the tram. What earns this place three stars instead of two is the at-times stunning design and visuals. Some of the sight-lines are downright fun. Ultimately, I don't know who actually shops here. Maybe the celebs who roll into town and want to be seen. It's almost as though this is the retail equivalent of plastic surgery addiction. Sooner or later you hit the point of diminishing returns and what was once beautiful becomes sad and depressing.",2
24080,"We stopped here to quickly satisfy my gelato cravings while running to the Bellagio Fountain show. I've had tons of gelato in the past, and I have to say--this place left me hanging. I don't know exactly what was wrong. Maybe the flavors were off, maybe the service was just crappy? The staff members seemed completely bored and did not want to help us. No offers of samples or any sign of courtesy at all. It was very mehhhhhh. And to piss me off even more, there was another damn gelato stand RIGHT next to the Bellagio exit. WTF.",1
31675,"If your idea of a fun night in Vegas is a crowded, unorganized, dark and dingy club, then Haze is for you! I was highly UNIMPRESSED with this nightclub inside of the newly opened Aria. Here are some bullet points: -Try looking around at the queue outside the club. Is it filled with all the rejects of the better clubs around? You bet. I saw a girl wearing a hankerchief top and jean shorts and somehow, SOMEHOW she was let in without cover. That would not fly at XS or PURE. Jesus. The bouncers have absolutely no standards in dress code. -This place is a horrendous maze. If you're not getting shoved out of a hallway you're climbing stairs to find a bar or a dancefloor. It's like the people who designed this place are making you work for your drunken night of debauchery. F**k that! I want to get drunk and dance in the fastest and most fun way possible. -Haze is crowded and not in a good way. This is a new club, so people have to be let in, but it's like they let in everyone and their ugly cousin. Gross. Don't get me wrong; I am no supermodel, but I know how to clean up and have at least moved beyond the trashy years of college Vegas trips. I don't think I've seen that much dimpled ass-cheek hanging out in my entire life. . The place was so packed with nasty that I spent half the time rubbing elbows with the unwanted and poorly groomed. Blech. Thank god we got free and VERY STRONG drinks and ditched this place. NEVER AGAIN HAZE. NEVER AGAIN.",0

We went it late at a Fri night 8/24 since we were juz arrived in Vegas that night. So we had to order in the late night menu. The sushi rolls we got were pretty amazing, the cocktails -- sinatra smash and my passion fruit mocktail though i added patron tequila tasted so delish. Our servers were great and very friendly. One the most stood for me, Christopher, because he recommended which clubs to go and the best nights when to go and suggested foods that would go great with our drinks. He was super friendly. I would go back again..",3
48451,"Thought I would give the Hula another try. Had the pork sandwich with coleslaw. Short story is the pork was tough as leather and hard to chew.

Can't say that Hula will be a return visit, but who knows.",0
39476,"Went to Genghis a few months ago, and it's quite the unique experience. You pick what you want food-wise (they offer suggestions, or you can do it on your own), and place it in a little bowl. It gets cooked and then delivered to your table. I made my own, and frankly, it was disgusting; however, Genghis has a business model that's brilliant. I can't blame them for my food being bad, because I made it! I'll definitely go back again and try something they know is edible lol.",2
35751,"My sister yelped viet food and this was the first restaurant that came up and there was a lot of good comments. I was so glad she found this restaurant. It is on the Asian food strip on spring mountain. However, it is little further down then most of the restaurants. The restaurant is in the same plaza as a message place. The restaurant was actually very clean. Even the veggies that came with the food was very clean. The bean sprouts were super white and the ends were picked off too! The servers were very nice. There was a check in special for 2 free egg rolls. I showed the server the coupon and he brought our whole table some egg rolls to share. The egg rolls were delicious! I love egg rolls and usually have them at every restaurant I go to. These were awesome. They used the Vietnamese wrappers which made the skin kind of chewy, and crunchy at the same time. My sister and I liked it so much we ordered a full order. My sister had the pho and the broth was surprisingly very flavorful. I had bun bo hue and it really hit the spot. The broth was well flavored and spicy. The meat was tender and they do give you a lot of meat. There is only 1 size for all the noodles soups and it was a pretty big bowl. Overall, a clean environment with good food and service! I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",3
36825,"HoMa has really started to turn around and is actually starting to get some nice restaurants there. La Cervoise is one of them. This small restaurant on Ontario St. has a great ambiance and good food to go along with it. To start I had a tomato zucchini salad which wasn't the best part of the meal and hence the reason I took off a star. The tomatoes weren't very ripe and the salad was a little on the bland side. The main course though was a definite rebound from the start of the meal. I had boar ribs which fell away from the bone and were seasoned with a really nice sauce. They came with fries and a choice of mayo (pesto, garlic, chili and I think there were one or two more choices). I'm a fan of garlic mayo on my fries and this one was quite good. Lastly I finished off with a chocolate mousse garnished with a raspberry coulis which was a great way to finish off a good meal. I am a fan of this place and I'd recommend it to anyone if they're in the area. It's a great little neighbourhood restaurant.",3
20375,"At La Quinta, no matter where it is located, I have always had a consistently good experience. The rooms are nothing special, but they usually check off our major needs list when we are on a road trip: Does it have a clean bed? Check. Does it have a hot shower? Check. Is it affordable? Check. Is it going to be located in the city/town we are stopping in? Check. Can they accomodate last minute reservations? Check. Do they allow slightly overweight, gas-y, lazy, flat-faced, wrinkly guests? Check. So, I got myself a rewards card and now, no matter where we travel we stay here. Honestly, I was pretty bummed we had to stay here on our trip through Vegas, though. We had our dog with us so it severly limited the places we could stay in and afford on our trip. (By the way, that slightly overweight, gas-y, lazy, flat-faced, wrinkly guest I was speaking of earlier was my English Bulldog, not my husband. I just want to clarify so I don't get in trouble later!) I was surprised to find that there were a few hotels on the strip that did allow dogs. I have never seen them on the strip or in any hotel/casino, so I just assumed they weren't. But, I was shocked to see that it is considered an upgrade to stay in a dog-friendly room and therefore the price practically doubled per night! But no fear, the La Quinta saved the day! They even offered a free shuttle that takes you to Harrah's on the strip so you don't have to keep taking a cab back and forth. It will also pick you up from Harrah's at the end of the night if you just call and wait for it outside by the taxi call. This made having to stay here all the more enjoyable and tolerable. I mean, who seriously wants to stay in some ho-hum hotel off the strip when you are in Vegas?! Not this girl!",2
44337,"I want to start off by saying that the participating restaurants weren't to blame for what was wrong with this event - the tacos were all delicious. My problem with the event was that it was extremely disorganized. It was damn near impossible to get a drink or to stand in the shade or to even get into the place. I tried not to hold a grudge on the line to get in, but holy hell. It was all enough to discourage me from coming back. If this was the first Taco Festival, I'd be more understanding. I'll bet the layout made total sense before they let people come inside. They need to check out a few Tempe Town Lake events to see how it's done. There were several Valley events running concurrent with this one (like Tour de Fat)... Next year I may do something else. Overall though, I'm glad I went. I was able to sample some really tasty tacos. The offerings from Vitamin T, Cien Agaves, and Blanco's were excellent. We didn't have a single bad taco actually - can't recall every place we tried, but it was all good. I probably will go again at some point because I love tacos and I love to support good local restaurants, but I'm not in a hurry.",1
34241,"My rate is based on quantity, not quality. We ordered carryout for dinner and for 3 adults ordered 3 specialty rolls and one regular roll. We were charged $50 and recieved the food and were incredibly disappointed with the size of the specialty rolls. When I called I had asked about the size and the hostess assured me that the specialty rolls were 8pcs and much more filled. Maybe it is because we had carryout but it was nowhere near enough food to feed 3 adults for dinner and we were not going to pay more. We went back with our food and explained our disappointment and they kindly refunded us our money, although, wouldn't you have thought they would stand by their food and try to make us happy by giving us more food to try? At least then there would be a chance of us going back if we liked the food! I am by no means a food or sushi snob but I like to be filled when I eat. We decided to try Simplee Sushi down the road and got more for our money and the rolls were larger as well. She even included 3 free soups! Will be hesitant to go back to Wild East and will never carryout again.",0
26084,Positives: Chips and salsa came right away. Chips were fresh and warm. The regular salsa (not the hot) was actually really good. Negatives: Ordered spinach enchiladas. Very bland tasting. My wife ordered a combination plate which was also very bland. Overall very unimpressed.,1

Then what's pizzanatali.net? and why when you go to that website does it have a see the menu and order online button? Beyond that silliness the pizza was average, too much sauce. Wings were good though. Place was dirty inside. Dust everywhere, even on front counter. Won't go again.",0

35853,"Before it's recent refurbishment, the outside of Cafe Salvo made it look like a slightly dingy, not very special, quick place to grab a coffee at best, kinda place. Inside was a whole other story. Cafe Salvo is the sort of cafe restaurant I imagine New York has a lot of. Black and white photographs of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Marilyn Monroe and other classic American movie stars don the walls. The interior is small, perhaps a little cluttered, but altogether homely and has a family run sort of feel. I think the owner has made this cafe just the way he wants it. He has his decorations and the film stars he wants. This makes the place feel genuine. As for the food, expect big portions of home made style cuisine. Don't expect anything too fancy, expect your lasagna and minestrone soup. The prices however are very reasonable. For about the cost of a coffee and panini at Starbucks you could have a three course set meal at Salvo. A genuine, distinct Italian cafe with reasonable prices and homely food. Highly recommended.",3
43026,"Let's face it - we are all both attracted to and repulsed by the buffet experience at the same time. It's probably the allure of getting a deal by paying a fixed price and making off with more food than we should, while paying as little as possible. Enter the churrascaria - put another way: Lots 'o meat. Is it authentic? Perhaps. I really can't say. I can say that they are neither the best nor the worst such experience I have ever had, and you are probably likely to find both better and worse places to spend your money to eat (both buffet and non-buffet alike). First, if you're going for dinner, you may not want to eat lunch beforehand. Perhaps for several days. It's a lot of food, mostly meat. While there is a salad bar, let's face it - no one goes to a place specializing in meat, delivered to your table and gets a salad bar. It doesn't make sense on any level. While the salad bar isn't bad, you're simply wasting your money by filling up your gut on salad, so even though it's not bad, skip it and eat your fill of meat. If you absolutely must have salad, try the lunch instead. You can then have the salad and a smaller sampling of the meats, at a lower price. For dinner, you get the full array of meats - unless you go for restaurant week, where they do a section between lunch and the full spread - so that's going to be full price. And those meats are brought around on these long skewers. The servers are supposed to look at the card on your table, and if the card is green, offer you food, and if the card is red, they keep going. In reality, the card doesn't matter much. If you get their attention, they will serve you, and that is the real problem - you can generally get it, but only at certain times, and you will find that if you want to try everything they offer, it takes a very long time. Everyone wants to try everything on the menu, and so when a new skewer comes out, the meat is rapidly gone, so it takes a while for the variety to make its way around the room - you then have to put in a request. As a result, the most common meats are the ones you see most frequently. I suspect these are the cheapest (understandably - that way they make the most money), and so you have to decide if it's worth $30+ on dinner. Generally it's a losing proposition, as you get increasingly frustrated because the more interesting items are never making their way to you. Still, if you've never been, it's worth a trip - probably not worth multiple trips, however.",1
14023,"O-mazing? Quite possible. I think part of Cirque du Soleil's **WOW** factor is dependant on how frequent you see a Cirque du Soleil \""type\"" show. The very first CdS I saw touring in the nineties was frakken O-MAZING! Back in the day, a $50 ticket went a long way towards entertainment. I like to think MY PERSONAL support of the Montreal touring troupe helped pave the way to the spectacle currently in Vegas (I also invented the Man Hug and originated the saying, \""Play it by ear\""). I've seen a few variations of the traveling Cirque du Soleil show, and the **WOW** factor has diminished with each show. O-MAZING becomes O-right to only O-kay. I'm jaded to the quality of CdS because of the expectation that they will outperform last year's show. However, the core of CdS is the same routine OVER and OVER: clowns, asian contortionists, trapeze artists and mood music. By the time the show Dralion toured in their familiar blue & yellow tent, I thought the routine was Bo-O-ring. However, \""O\"" at the Bellagio in Vegas adds an interesting twist to the familiar routine. I don't want to take anything away from the many skilled performers, musicians and costumes, but I think the STAR of \""O\"" is the ebb and flow of the moving stage that can in seconds morph from an ethereal landscape to depths of danger and excitement. Beneath the stage is a little Vegas secret. The stage is powered by hundreds of dwarves shoulder atop shoulder. But don't quote me on that. Cirque du Soleil tickets are a good gift to give to someone who has never seen the show. I think it's also a good gift to give to yourself if you haven't been over-saturated with such theatrics. You can look for discounted tickets at Showcase on the Las Vegas Blvd near MGM. The only thing that I didn't like about \""O\"" was... **SPOILER** ...the use of audience plants. A clown will pull an \""unsuspecting\"" person from the audience (read: plant) for some onstage fun and then suddenly that person is whisked into the show and diving off 50 ft platforms! Hello liability. Gimme a break! Health care may be free in Canada, but no way does that stuff just happen in America. These French farts have used this foolery in a few Cirque du Soleil shows. The \""A\"" in America doesn't stand for absent minded. Would I go back? Gonna play it by ear.",3

36321,"I don't understand how Alex R could have given this 5 stars (yes Alex, I'm calling you out). Firstly, I urge you to read his review as it's hilarious, and it gives context to my review. In the context of Alex R's review, I am of the WALKING category on this bridge. Occasionally waiting for a bus and sometimes cycling. But mainly walking. And when it comes to walking on this bridge, it's a total 'mare. Despite the quite wide streets, there are even more bus stops and it means that you often have to stop, quite literally, stop in your tracks and navigate around huge crowds of people. Couple this with the Edinburgh Rain and the Edinburgh Wind and the fact it's a wide open space which makes it the perfect place for the Wind and Rain to meet in full force, I never have fun walking over this bridge. The only stars it gets are for the view. Walking into the Old Town, on your left you have Arthur's Seat and on your right you have all the amazing, beautiful old building that date back almost 1000 years (well Old Town itself does). Oh but wait, there are probably lots of people stopping to take photos of the beautifulness which further adds to the congestion. Rant over. I dont really like crossing this bridge, but it does do a pretty good job of connecting the Old and New Town so that's saying something.",1

The decor is cheesy. Skip.",1
4706,"I stayed at this hotel the very first time I went to Vegas, which was in November 2006. It was scary from the moment we walked into the lobby. My friend said it best, \""It looks like the kind of place you see in horror movies. The kind where you go in and never come out.\"" I guarantee if you stay here you'll definitely want to come right back out. The elevators are spooky, and so were both of the rooms we saw. Yes, we saw two rooms because the room they originally sent us to was not ready. As in it looked as if the previous guests had left about 5 minutes prior to our arrival. It was a mess. The room we ended up staying in wasn't a whole lot better. the bathroom was disgusting (there was urine on the floor) the toilet barely worked, and the faucet handle kept coming off whenever you tried to wash your hands. Our room was right on the freeway side, so I guess it's a good view if you like looking out the window at the 15 (not to mention HEARING the 15 freeway). The staff did as little as they possibly could to resolve our issues, and the assistant manager was one of the most arrogant, condescending persons I've come across in life period, not just when it comes to hotel staff. He didnt offer so much as an apology, and was absolutely not subtle about the fact that he didn't want to be bothered with us. Our reservation was for 2 days but we checked out the morning after our 1st night there, we have no intention of going back, and want to warn any others that may consider staying at this hotel. Pros: Nothing Cons: Everything",0

13346,"In typical birthday tradition, my wife and I always go somewhere different, usually an establishment with a a-list chef, or at least a michelin star or james beard nom...where else to go while in Vegas, but Bouchon, Thomas Keller's restaurant. I had extremely high expectations on this restaurant, as I have been to Thomas' other restaurants, Per Se and French Laundry. Bouchon seemed like a cross between The Palm and a high end Cheesecake Factory. Perhaps it was because we were in Vegas, and Bouchon was in the Venetian with a heavy tourist population, but nonetheless, the vibe didn't scream out \""5 stars\"". The service was slow, probably due to the overly packed restaurant, and the vibe really reminded me of an energetic Cheesecake Factory. The food itself was good. There definitely was no comparison to Keller's other restaurants...not even in the same category, but regardless, it was good. I started with the squash salad, which was interesting and good. For my entree, I had the special, which was a top sirloin prepared sous vide with a side of spinach and mashed. The meat was very lean and prepared very well, no complaints here. The part of the meal that did stand out was the homemade bread. So good and buttery. I might give Bouchon another chance and try the one in Beverly Hills.",2

3829,"Unfortunately, I had a really terrible experience at this salon. I was excited to try a new place for a great price (with a gel manicure groupon) however when I got to the salon, the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened. I saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke. After I showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying I need to pay again, that my groupon was invalid, and basically accusing me of stealing. I was horrified. She then proceeded to turn to her coworkers and very obviously talk about me. It was the most appalling customer service I have ever seen. She went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though I had a legitimate groupon. I would have left immediately had my friend (who also had a groupon) was not already inside. My friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any problems. She also simply showed her phone to the person, pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace. We were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer. I am never going back.",0
1833,went here to celebrate an interview my wife went to. Had wine. Thats about it. Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer).

28994,"For a minute I thought the commuter terminal at PHX didn't even have a bar, then I stumbled into \""All Star Sports Bar.\"" After spending about an hour here I wish there was no bar at all. This place fails on almost every level imaginable. First of all, it's not anywhere close to being a sports bar. 2 TV's and bartenders in referee uniforms doesn't make you a sports bar. Furthermore, the food here could not be worse. Look - I'm not opposed to the plastic cheese from a can on nachos, but if you can't even make that taste good, I can't even begin to imagine what the rest of the food here is like. Unlike the other reviewers I actually found the service (at the bar) to be fine, if not indifferent, and the one good thing I will say about this place is that they do make a pretty good Bloody Mary. You can credit that to the Ocean Spray mix they used so it's not exactly rocket science ... What can you do though? They have a captive audience though being the only game in the terminal after the security check point, I'd imagine this place is a zoo on Friday afternoons ...",0

After our event which by the way no management came out to say is everything okay or is there anything you need....we decided to order. Had to flag down the waiter. They brought over one menu for a table of five, then had to ask for water. After ordering it took approx 25 minutes for our food to arrive. Then it was brought out without utensils or napkins. Might as well have been a self serve. Plus one of the items that we ordered never arrived! Had to also go inside and request check.

I ended up with some bright crazy crap and the \""stone\"" massage isn't even worth mentioning. Waste of time and money. My acrylic set turned out less than average. Even though it's a whole new full set it looks like a back fill and has visible bubbles. Biggest problem was that the big sign out front says $18 pedicure $22 full set- ended up costing me $58! Yeah why they charged me $40 for a $22 set beyond me. And of course they couldn't tell me why it was $40 bc they didn't \""understand\"" what I was saying. Again.

29943,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a desk jockey that writes reviews on restaurants based on portion size, wait time and how important they made me feel. It's about the food! My credentials are: 10 years back of the house fine dining experience and 6 years dining professionally as a fine wine distributor. I've never had a bad meal at The Parlor and generally find myself talking for days about whatever the latest seasonal menu item I've tried is. That said, any restaurant is destined to have an inconsistency now and then... It's just never happened to me here. Let me get to the point. I'm a very adventurous eater but now and then when I find a classic dish that is executed in superb fashion, I'll fall back to it time and time again. THE PARLOR MAKES THE BEST CAESAR SALAD IN THE VALLEY. It's such a simple preparation yet somehow 95% of valley restaurants do something to screw it up. They either deconstruct it and make it a chore to eat or put there own twist on it that completely takes it out of the realm of what a caesar salad is. How arrogant. Too all other PHX restaurants: Just because you use romaine doesn't make it a Caesar. Lesson: Caesar Salad = Chopped or torn Romaine hearts, Creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh toasted (and seasoned) croutons and some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.

So, I booked a same-day appointment and came here for my lunch one day! The parking lot is definitely bustling with activity as there are a LOT of businesses here, so I'd suggest just going to the far back rows and parking. Just be careful of walking since you'll be trekking across the busy driveway entrance. Inside it's a little smaller than the one I'm used to, but still pretty nice. Checked in, filled out paperwork for the facial, then sat in the quiet room. Quiet room isn't terribly quiet though as you can hear the chatter of outside. Doesn't really affect me one way or the other but if you're trying to relax it may suck. My facial lady came out a few minutes after my appointment and apologized for being late; apparently the front didn't tell her that she had another appointment. Happens I guess - never had any sort of problems like that with the other location. We go in and do the facial biz which was nice and relaxing, and she actually gave me the couple extra minutes back (she apologized again for being tardy) even though she had another appointment after me - super cool. I go out to check-out and one girl was on the computer looking intently at something (no customer in front of her, mind you) and the other lady was assisting someone. So, I used the restroom and came back and the aesthetician had put some suggestions up on the counter. The lady at the front started automatically scanning them and I was like, \""Yeah not today, thanks.\"" I am REALLY not a big fan of upselling when you just assume the customer is going to purchase whatever is there.

You can order noodle soups, different fried rice combinations, shrimp, chicken wings, sweet potato fries, omelets, duck, chinese veggies, fried pork, chicken, beef, and even a rib eye burger. It's quite a small location but the food is served and cooked very fast. They even provided us with free chinese tea to begin with. I met the owner of the cafe \""Wendy\"" and she was a very friendly person who made sure that were satisfied with what they had to offer and indeed we were.

I want to start by saying that anyone reviewing an airport shuttle service must be pissed off at the level of service but there are some good solid reviews here. That being said, next time, I am taking a cab! This chodu was wainting outside of the Venetian on his phone. When I asked how much to the airport he offered the price of $8. So far so good. I asked how long to the airport and he told me that he would be waiting until 25 minutes after the hour but had a pick up at Ceasars, after that 10 minutes until the airport. Still going strong... We agreed and he grabbed our luggage. Thank God it's strong luggage because he wasn't careful. I was waiting for him to get up and body slam anything he thought may not be broken for good measure. But I guess the airlines are no different I told myself. After ten minutes and a few other travellers joining he asked what airline we were all taking and we parted on time! We picked up the other couple and were well on our way to the airport. We got to terminal one and he waved at one couple who got off and we again parted. The other terminal was quite a distance I thought. What an airport! We pulled up and he says \""Virgin Airlines, this stop\"" so all but me and my wife got up to leave. My wife and I remained still waiting for our stop. He saw this and asked again what airlines we were on. When I told him he lost it! There is no better word, he simply lost it. He told me I lied to him and that we said Virgin Airlines and told us too bad, we had to get off the bus. When I tried to reason with him he said \""If you argue, I will call the police\"" realizing we now had 60 minutes, were at the wrong terminal and he held our baggage I saw the lost cause on inviting him to call. I told him that he didn't deliver us to our destination so he didn't deserve to get paid for his lack of service, courtesy and absolutely rude behaviour. He continued to lose it and threatened to keep our luggage. Short of taking a swing I gave him his money, grabbed our bags and started our journey of finding a way to the other terminal before we missed our flight! We made it but my recommendation is to get a cab. Unless you REALLY enjoy gambling, these shuttles are not worth the risk.",0
48858,"I'm writing this review with a heavy heart. I'm from around the Bisbee area and have eaten at the original Bisbee Breakfast Club. Their service is NOTHING like the service at this one...theirs is fast and efficient. The first time I came here, things were good. We were seated quickly because there were no people. Food was really good, but took forever to come. I thought nothing of it and thought that the next time would be better. How wrong I was. The second time let me see how badly this place was run. The restaurant has potential but it's being run to the ground by the manager. At least I think she's the manager. She was the women seating people the two times that I've been there. Has somewhat of a hippy look. She needs to be trained IMMEDIATELY. She's beyond unprofessional and her staff is following suit. The bus boy cleaning tables hated his job. He was so slow doing his job and would throw things around. The waitresses were more interested in conversation with each other than servicing their customers. We were sitting for a good 10-15 min before someone took our drink order. The \""manager\"" told a waitress to get our drinks. The waitress came over to our table hating life and asked \""what do you want to drink?\"" There was no smile, how are you, I'm sorry for the wait, nothing. I wouldn't believe what I was seeing. The food is pretty good, it's a shame that the service is driving people away. I hope something is done soon and they either train the manager or get rid of her altogether. The sooner they correct the issue, the sooner people can return and support a local gem.",1
19165,"Went in on a weekday around 4pm. There were four other tables, three of which were already served when we came in and one that was seated after us, a party of two looking to spend around $40. 26 minutes later, and we still has not been asked our order. We had our menus closed and were waiting to spend our money. Alas, the Chinese wait staff served the Chinese customers who came in after us, so we ended up leaving and spending money elsewhere. If you can wait more than 26 minutes to be checked on, and tolerate differential service that appears based on skin color and appearance, maybe this place is for you. It's not for us and I've removed it from my restaurant rotation. We'll have no problem finding solid Asian fare in this town.",1
37887,"I HATE paying $14 for a drink. I not only paid $14 for one drink, but I liked it so much I bought another one. My boyfriend (who is also cheap like me) ordered a second drink. Jason was our bartender and suggested I try the Immaculate Conception, which was like a Manhattan, if a Manhattan had some edible gold and some sort of chai flavor to it. It was AMAZING and very pretty. My boyfriend got the Cereal Killer and it tasted like what your milk tastes like at the end of eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch, so it was pretty awesome. There was a decent live band playing that night and it was a fun atmosphere. I totally suggest it, but set aside some extra money for it first.",4
35297,"It's outside in a huge white tent & the bathrooms outside is pretty nice so I heard. There is AC & music in the bathroom LoLz. The seats inside are very uncomfortable, your shoulder to shoulder, also I felt like someone was breathing down my neck the whole time. Once someone moved on their seat you can feel like because the chair are all connected in a one piece moving line thing on the bottom. I was on floor level which is a bad idea. Had to keep moving around to see everything. I guess being short doesn't help too. sigh. So besides from a hurting neck and back pains. The show was just OK. It's kind of like the blue man group. They made fun of other shows and they bring people up stage to make fun of. The music they pick was up beat, like a mini party. Bottom line thank god I didn't pay for these tickets are I'll be piss. I got them for free.",1
43877,Fat kid heaven!!! So many choices it is overwhelming. My suggestion is to first do a full walk through to peruse all your options before committing to anything. Heard that they have a 24 hour pass you can purchase for something like $50 which is totally worth it! I'd probably start with dinner and then let it lap over into the next day trying to fit in as many meals as possible :). Oysters were fresh and delicious! And don't make the same mistake I did and fill up on fresh juice!,4
2069,"I cannot begin to express how poorly I think of Corporate Office Centers. As the reviewer before me stated, the location is ideal and the offices are lovely, but the customer service is atrocious. I had a one-year lease in the office with a number of challenges throughout my term. Unfortunately, my requests for assistance fell on deaf ears. The staff is trained to make money, NOT to help tenants. Below are some examples: Shortly after I moved into the office, I was told that I could not use my AirPort to connect my Mac to my printer and make a wireless environment. That meant that I had to run wires across the office and inconvenience my clients when they visited the office. Apparently, had I paid an additional fee, I could have used my AirPort, which is NOT a router, as specified in my contract and verbally. Then, when faced with personal and professional financial challenges, I approached the management about moving to a virtual office or finding another solution so I would not have to endure continued financial hardship. Again, I was flatly denied the option to even discuss the situation. Finally, after ending my lease, I was BILLED! The management requires a substantial deposit, yet I was billed for mail forwarding and cleaning. I had less than $3 worth of mail forwarded to me because I picked up the other pieces. I also never used or publicized the number provided by Corporate Office Centers, as I just forwarded my own number. Therefore, my COC number was not used, even though I still received a $375 fee. And cleaning a 125-square-foot office for $325? I have had my entire 1,300-square-foot home professionally cleaned for little more than that. That amount is ridiculous, especially since I cleaned all surfaces before vacating. I will vehemently discourage others from using Corporate Office Centers as they are a complete rip-off. I have heard this tale of woe from others who were lured in and are now stuck. If you need an office space, do yourself a favor and avoid COC. It will only cost you if you go this route.",0
44757,"I wanted to really like this place, but there were a few things that kept me from loving it. My friend and I found this place through yelp, and were specifically looking for a happy hour place. Outside Voila's front door there was a sign that said that they had happy hour specials from 4pm-6pm, and we arrived at 4:15pm and found that their front door was locked. Hmph. We were peering into the restaurant when an employee of the restaurant came up from behind us and told us that the restaurant doesn't open until 5pm. He then offered to let us in so we could wait around for 45 minutes for the servers to arrive?? We politely declined this bizarre offer and decided to go to Goldie's next door. At 5pm we returned, and ended up ordering two glasses of house red and a large moules frites to share. The food was delicious, and the wine was very tasty.",2
43993,"So when you walk into the Luxor and the line to check-in is miles long, do yourself a favor; go have a drink + snack at Public House. They have some decent beers on draft and pulled off a solid dirty martini. We stopped in here 3 times durring our stay and it was primarily because of the nachos. They are ketel chips with pulled pork, cheese, a spicy creamy drizzle with jalape\u00f1os. A decent snack split between two. When chatting up the others at the bar, they were local staff on the strip ordering burgers and sandwiches. When the locals are there, you know the place is solid.",2
29904,"Grounds and main buiding are 5-star; beautiful building and grounds that hearken back to a byegone era: the late 1920s and early 1930s. Some of the rooms hearken back to an era that occasions less nostalgia: the late 80s/early 90s, which is when i think my room was last renovated. But the thing that causes me to post this is that THE INTERNET ACCESS IN THE ROOMS IS INCREDIBLY UNRELIABLE. I haven't had such a bad connection since the early days of dial-up. I've been at this hotel for three days for business and my internet access has crashed on me at least three times every day, twice nearly blowing a deadline as I've been unable to send a document to my home office. The front desk was no help at all: first they dropped me while supposedly transfering me to tech support, and then simply didn't answer the phone (it rang over 50 times, which simply shouldn't happen at a front desk). On my last night here, I gave up and walked from my \""cottage\"" to the lobby. Internet access is working passably so far here -- at least for now.",2
39738,"Super speedy online ordering and they come to your house so quick! Can't beat that. Hey it's Chinese food, not rocket science. It gets the job done for those awesome cravings. I am not a frequent diner at Chinese food restaurants, but all I know is that this tastes great and is delivered fast for my lazy days. Can't beat that.",4
16876,"Love this place...I like that it is strangley situated in a business center, and I drove around like a fool before finding it. I first spotted the outside patio area, it was very Miami, white curtains flowing, comfy patio furniture, there was a wedding party there and it looked so fashionable, like out of a magazine. The inside decor was a mixture of contemporary/modern Pottery Barn-esque with a splash of beach feel, I liked the little nooks built into the wall, it was like just a little bit of Morocco thrown in as well. Ok onto the food, the first time I went there I did a cheese board and some wine, they have a great cheese selection and I really enjoyed my order. Second time I had split 2 entrees with my friend so we could try both, we ordered the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes, I politely asked if they could hold the butter, and the server was very nice, didn't give me a hard time, this dish was wonderful, halibut was cooked to perfection, definitely recommend, the show stopper though was the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth. This was so delicious, comparable to cioppino, but the saffron broth gave it a different twist. The calamari was outstanding. Service was outstanding, our server was very attentive, my water glass was never empty, they continually came around to give you more bread, oh the bread....awesome bread basket....carb addicts dream. The is a place I wouldn't hesitate to take out of towners or recommend to locals.",4
45948,"Went to this Chipotle tonight, ordered a burrito to go and when I got home to enjoy my burrito the rice inside what not cooked!!! WAYYY undercooked, hard and gross. Really disappointing to get home and not able to enjoy the food. Would have went back but decided it wasn't going to be worth it since they don't even know how to cook rice. Went to Cafe Rio's instead.",0
37742,"-checked in on foursquare and got free Mac &cheese nom noms! other things we got: Parmesan fries kale salad which was sooo good! and the I love seoul which I totally recommend!! These were split between 3 people so it was just enough! Also we're in vegas and i know all us girls don't want to eat too much bc we don't want to be fat for the clubs later, so come here if you're looking for something to eat that's affordable and splitable",4
3010,"Swaddee is awesome. I love the Chicken Noodles and the Thai Iced Tea. This place can get a little hectic during lunch so go early if you can. When you order they ask you how spicy you want your food, 1-5. I always get a 3, but the spice can be anywhere from a 2-4 which works for me.",3
44422,"This is the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I don't say that lightly, I've eaten at pizzeria bianco, cibo, spinatos, pizza a metro, and the like. At Federal they use fresh ingredients and it was tasty. Hipsters have infiltrated this establishment though. So if you have a fear of hipsters this isn't the spot for you. The house-made wine coolers are nice as well.",4
35378,"I just tried this place the other night on a whim with my friend. We both ordered the tostada bowl, to go, with Carne Asada. The place has a very different look to it. Funky decor. Young staff who were SUPER friendly and joking around with us. Very helpful and said hello the second we walked in the door. The Tostada Bowl was EXCELLENT! It was so delicious. Nice cruncy shell, with all the fixings you want inside. Shell did not get soggy and stayed nice and crunchy. Highly recommend giving this place a shot. I am surpriesd by the mixed reviews, I thought this place was great!",3
40018,"I'm here for Mother's Day and the service is terrible. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop entree for $23 and got one shrimp, one scallop and 4 small sticks of fried rice. It was tasty but too small. My husband ordered 4 sushi rolls but they took 40 minutes to come out. So, I ate my entree while he watched me eat it, then, he ate his rolls while I watched him eat. Don't think I'll be back.",1
13334,"We loved dinner so much here, we came back for the very next meal: breakfast! Although I liked the dinner far better than the breakfast (predictable, given my vegetarianism and dislike of eggs), I still want to give this five stars. It's possible that I was dazzled because I really never eat at restaurants of this quality. But if you also rarely dine like this, listen in: -Our server was adorable and fun, while still being respectful and unobtrusive. Think about it --is there better criteria for a waiter out there? He was like the perfect background music, and I'd go back for him alone. I wish I remember his name --a young 30-something Polish guy. But luckily there are many other reasons to return.... -The cheese course was perfect in its range and selections. Great accompaniments not only served alongside (honeycomb, the right breads and crackers), but also to the bread and pistachios at the table. -A wine list that gave just the right info to make good pairing choices. -I loved my gnocchi, served with winter vegetables in a mild and yet cohesive brown butter sauce. It was heavy and greasy, and somehow that was a good thing. A must-try! -Sides of pommes frites and mac and cheese set the bar for any future fry or mac 'n cheese, who will lose any battles they attempt. -Salad perfectly herbed and vinegared, worked great with the warm goat cheese. -The madiera tasting for dessert!!! I had good madiera in storage before this. Now nothing compares. This may be a bad thing in general. But that night, it was a very, very good thing. 1989 Madiera!! -I'm not a big breakfast fan, and I don't like meat or eggs. (Anyone still reading! haha) But I can say that the french toast was excellent despite the egginess. (It's more like a bread pudding, with apples.) And the cheese danish was the best I've ever had. I'll not only be back to Bouchon next time I'm in Vegas, but Bouchon in Napa is now on the list for our honeymoon next summer! Absolutely worth every single penny (yes, ALL of them). Go.",4
21702,"The good: The music was good if you like Hip Hop, decor was good, people were fine. The bad: Place was a mosh pit. The dance floor is tiny, there's NO room to walk through AT ALL. Line for bathrooms was so bad, we just went back to our rooms to use the bathroom and were so over the crowds we didn't bother going back (stayed at the Luxor). A busy club is a good thing but for f***'s sake I think being able to get through the club w/o almost fighting 3 people is not too much to ask for. BTW, suggestion for the DJ, playing \""Move Bitch\"" by Ludacris NOT a good idea in that club...suggestion hits too close to home.",1
23681,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I don't like. Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.,4
5557,"Last time I ordered to go, I got the chow mein noodles instead of fried rice. When I got home, I opened my box to find literally chow mein noodles. No sauce, no veggies, nothing on the noodles. They basically boiled the noodles in water then placed in the box. Okay.... so I went back today. Got the lunch special. The chicken with mixed vegetables was good, but only the vegetables. The chicken was soggy and slimy and just not good. The fried rice was fried rice with egg. No vegetables. The service is also really strange and awkward. Time to find a new restaurant.",0
34730,Amazing drink prices especially noted is the $5 Patron. However the food is horrible. The burger meat has made me horribly sick. I still come here for the bar though. Great day drinking spot.,1
37607,"We dined for lunch at the Olive Garden restaurant off Germann Road. ordered as soup and salad combo. I asked for the chicken and gnocchi soup. I asked for no gnocchi in my soup and the server did that right. However, we didn't get our drinks till half way through our meal which I was pretty thirsty. Otherwise, our meal was as usual. Our server was nice and smiled a lot but we had to ask other servers to bring our water. I wouldn't write home about it.",2
17262,"Their soups are GREAT! The service can be iffy sometimes and it is very dark and hot. The employees are kind of a \""grunge\"" crowd. However, last time I went, I got food poisoning. I would say eat there, but the food is the only good part about it. Good selection of beer, wine...not at all.",1
3163,"Great course! However the locals (old people that could only afford to live on a golf course in BFE) think they run the place. The bartenders are pretty rude, as are the annoying messages they send your cart every hole (ex. Keep up with the group ahead... The same group you are caught up w and waiting on). They definitely over schedule the Tee times. I will say the course staff (rangers, food service) were great.",1
47610,"Have been going back and I love this place. More ppl should come out. Have had the pastrami burger, avocado burger and bacon cheeseburger. All very good and their wait time at the drive thru has shortened considerably. Make the drive or stop by. Way better than InAndOut.",4

My favorite drinks always taste so much better here! The staff is excellent. The only time I ever had to wait long for a drink, they apologized for it by giving me a free drink coupon. Apology accepted and incident forgotten! I love this place!",4
49835,"First visit to this place and it was off the hook. Now the clarification. We ordered food to go, the Thai Clam Chowder, the Dragon Fries, a Chicken sandwich and two Pho Dip sandwiches. The food is SPICY there is no doubt about that. The fries were AWESOME, spicy, garlicky, everything they said they would be ...YES I love spicy food. The Pho Dip's were AMAZING. I love French Dip Sandwiches but this one with the twist they put on it was a really amazing sandwich and to me beats any French Dip you will find in this town. The chicken sandwich was good I am told but the chicken did have the fatty part of the skin on it which was a turn off for the person eating it. The claim chowder with the Thai twist I am told was very spicy as well and they were not able to eat it because of the spice level but said the soup itself did have a good taste if not for the spice. Some can hang and some cannot. I will visit this place again as there are other items on the menu I would like to try. This is a place if you like spice, you should definitely try. If you don't like spice, stop and talk to the guys there and see if they can take it down a notch although in my opinion that would defeat the purpose of their food but overall it was amazing and I will be back.",4
39843,"Spacious, clean place. Friendly people. Delicious warm bread and Beverage glasses kept full. My companions really liked the red snapper special and spaghetti and meatballs . Both stated it was very flavorful. I ordered Manila clams with linguine. The dish had lots of mussels but was bland. Linguine was cooked perfectly Al Dente. I tend to like food spicy so I cannot say the dish was poorly made. I would come back but this place is not the top of my list.",2
6489,"We got the calamari as our appetizer which was good. The sangria was perfect--we were all happy with it. I was really disappointed then when the entrees came after the beginning of the meal was so good-I thought the main course would be as well. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I got a seafood medley on top of angel hair pasta. The pasta was stuck together in clumps--I guess they forgot to stir it while it was boiling. The seafood was ok--the dish was so flavorless. If my eyes were closed, I would have no idea I was eating scallops, shrimp, etc. My husband's dish was basically the same as mine. Flavorless. Our friends ordered the specials and were really happy with those, so maybe go with the specials if you eat here. For the amount of money this meal was and how disappointing it was, I would not return.",2
5892,"Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.",0
45325,"I would probably go back to this place because of its location and atmosphere. It is a relaxed, fun place to be. Plenty of activities and drink choices. The service was wonderful. The server was very professional and friendly. My only reason for not giving it more stars was the food. It was Ok. I tried the fish and chips. The fish was okay. The batter was light and fluffy but bland.. The tarter sauce was boring and bland too. No zing or even some kind of flavor. The fries were fresh cut but were so salty making them difficult to eat. I had to dust the salt off. The cole slaw was the best part and even that wasn't very exciting. My co-worker who joined me, had the Kale & Sweet Potato Salad. She enjoyed it except for the pomegranates that come with it but aren't listed in the description on the menu. I had a bite and did find the dressing to be delicious. I'll go back but will try something else on the menu and hopefully it will taste better than this past lunch.",2
6834,"If I can't give the Key a 5 star rating, I don't know what I would. As a disclaimer, I worked there for 2 years and left on unsavory terms with the owner. The fact that she (wears the pants) and her husband are doing back-to-back prison sentences bumps it from a 4 to a 5. Now, any bar in madison on friday or saturday is bound to be butts-to-nuts busy, so don't take away stars for it being packed, that's just dumb. Drinks=strong. I'd be hardpressed to tell you the prices, but I'm guessing they're average. Stick to specials and you'll do all right. In response to another reviewer... most male bartenders come off as tools, it's in the job description, and the Key's aren't on the same level as those at Brothers, Mad Ave or even (maybe even especially) the Nitty. Food=Exceptionally good bar food+a ton of it+cheap. A burger special is $5 and it's uncomfortable to finish all of it. I recommend trying. If you're ambling towards Camp Randall or the Kohl Center, stop in for a quick round or two of shots. It's easy enough to get to the bar in a timely manner and it's right on the way for a lot of you.",4
36769,"8/11/13 Treated BIL and two sisters to Under the Sun tour tonight. Five bands from the 90s: Fastball http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=RfNj5ybfKpJJbWPb0Djjow#RfNj5ybfKpJJbWPb0Djjow, Vertical Horizon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=uu0AHwsRJNeJfqLjjmmmFA#uu0AHwsRJNeJfqLjjmmmFA, Gin Blossoms http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=Z8xLBOjBZU9hbpfXpkL03g#Z8xLBOjBZU9hbpfXpkL03g, Sugar Ray (vocal Mark McGrath mentioned his vision of this lineup, so I assumed he organized it) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=Zevu6onkEoU7bds_0uY8hg#Zevu6onkEoU7bds_0uY8hg, and Smash Mouth. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/time-warner-cable-uptown-amphitheatre-charlotte-charlotte?select=uJKwrXZuZA9HI4KemHAYIA#uJKwrXZuZA9HI4KemHAYIA We all agreed that Vertical Horizon, Gin Blossoms (!!), and Sugar Ray (!!) performed the best (great energy and stage presence), and Smash Mouth was a HUGE letdown. Lead singer Steve Harwell's vocal cords were shot-- the spoken bits of their songs sounded fine, but whenever he sang, his notes were all off-key. (I attributed it to heavy touring all summer long, but I see that the first show was on July 4th...?) It's a good thing most in attendance knew the words of \""All Star\"" word-for-word (but not me!), because Harwell didn't even need to be present! He did a lot of walking from one end of the stage to the other, and holding his mike stand out over the audience during the number. Don't get me wrong, SM played good music, but after Vertical Horizon, Gin Blossoms, and Sugar Ray's sets, Smash Mouth's was very anti-climactic. I'd say the combo of the earlier bands' lively performances, Harwell's blown vocals, and the day's heat and humidity had drained us of energy by concert's end... It was fun to see and hear band members moonlight on other bands' sets-- very cool. (I enjoyed Fastball, but sisters and BIL weren't familiar with their songs, and so didn't care. I just wished Fastball had put more effort in showing that they were happy to be there.) Should you attend a concert of this magnitude, I suggest you arrive early! Gin Blossoms' Robin Wilson invited everyone in attendance to move in closer to the stage by the second-half of their set, per amphitheatre's general director's discretion. Yep, lawn seat ticket-holders moved into seats that others had paid upwards of $80 or more... Two men almost duked it out two rows ahead of us-- guy and his date arrived late to claim their $75 seats, only to find lawn seat ticket holders standing their ground. Hey, I'd feel the same way if someone wouldn't give me the seats I'd paid for. (I paid $208, surcharges included, for four center row seats.) There were other open seats available, many closer to the stage... Ah, well. Be sure to have your tickets with you should you need to use the restroom, or buy drinks at the concession stands, for you will need them to return to your seats. Correction: we needed them, until the invite was given for the audience to move in closer, and then security and ushers left their posts. p.s. Compared to the Ak-Chin Pavilion (Phoenix, AZ; seats 20,000) I was at a few days before this event, this Charlotte arena is VERY SMALL (3,000 max capacity?; couldn't find much info online). Still a nice venue, and I wouldn't mind catching another concert here in the future.",2
32938,The thing that really stands out about Momoyama was the service. I enjoy the fact that I can go into the restaurant after a few weeks and the waitress knows what I want to drink. Great service goes a long way for me. The food is pretty good. It is All You Can Eat. I will go here again and again.,3
16615,"Had dinner here the other night, I wasn't pleased. Our waiter was AWFUL! He actually told me he'd get yelled at if my water glass wasn't full of water at all times, this was after I told him I didn't want anymore water. Really? This guys job is on the line because I drank some water? I thought he was unprofessional and noticed the his coworkers felt the same way. Then I saw at another table the server actually talking up the food and offering suggestions!! The food, well, some of it was good after I seasoned it at the table. The steak was under cooked but the salmon was good. The potatoes were bland, the Bearniaises sauce that accompanied the asparagus had separated and the asparagus itself was huge and woody, could only eat the tops. The wine was good! I expected more from a fancy $200 meal for two restaurant.",1
42888,"Went here tonight with the family. It isn't bad, however it isn't my favorite. Had the beef brisket platter with garlic mashed potatoes and jalapeno cole slaw. The brisket was decent. The potatoes were lumpy which I liked, however they were dry and I didn't taste garlic. Now the cole slaw on the other hand was delicious. It wasn't overly saturated with mayo, nor was it sweet. Should I come back, I will be ordering two sides of the cole slaw. The prices seem a bit high compared to their competitors.",2
4077,"oOoh I'm giving this place four stars based solely on how fancy, organized and the quality of the produce and meats are...and they have this really lovely bakery inside...I would like to try it one day. As for the service...I am not very content with...why? because.... So I was at the Butcher Corner's section looking at the selections of great beef cuts...I was pretty happy they have Filet Mignon and they looked like pretty good quality...and well for $26/lb they should be! Well so I've been standing there for awhile and there was a person behind the counter...I knew that knew that I was there but he didn't say anything. Then another person (old white Caucasian male) walks around the area just browsing..automatically the butcher guy asks him if he needs help...when I have been standing there for like 2 minutes. I was a little offended. Anyways besides that...this place is the equivalent of Bristol Farms in LA. This market has all the exotic and fine ingredients to make a delicious meal. =)",3
33578,"Decided to get a mani and pedi done for Christmas. Started off really good quick to get on a chair for my pedi. I wanted snowflakes and the lady said she could do them. Pedi seemed really rushed. Once pedi was done went on to getting my nails done. She wasn't rushing at first but the more time pass by more people started to show and out of all the workers she was the only one rushing. As she was doing my nails she kept looking around not realizing that she is taking off a lot of the nail. Also she kept filing and filing my nails which ended up shorter than I wanted. Everyone else was taking their times. I told her to slow down so she wouldn't mess up but sure enough, my nails Didnt turn out the way i wanted them to be done. Snowflakes don't even look like snowflakes. If she wasn't able to do the design I wanted she should of said so instead of going through with it and saying that's the best she can do. one side of my nails were done and it would of looked stupid for me to walk out with my hands looking different from each other. Never again will I go to this nail salon.",0

21018,"I've seen a few shows at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in my time in Charlotte. I've even been to a show where I won tickets and someone else drove a bus there. The one thing that they have going for them is plentiful parking. Lots all over the place. What makes it bad is that there aren't too many ways in and out - just one long road (it does go in two directions, however). That means the lines are really long when it's time to go home. Your best bet is to sit back and relax. Luckily most concerts have methods for relaxing, if you're into that. The venue itself is decent, if perhaps a bit aged. Lawn seats are generally a decent way to go if you don't mind crowds. The fixed seats can be had for a bargain if you wait for a deal. Either way will get you a surprise when you check out and see a parking fee and a ticket fee slapped on the price. Once you're there, however, look for an El Cheapo ticket for something like $10 for the next show, with no fees. That's the real bargain. You just have to like the show. Also be sure and watch out for hefty concessions. It's worse than athletic events, so bring your wallet. And ATM card. Pre-approval for a house loan probably wouldn't hurt.",2
313,"Elbow room has some great things going for it. It has a reasonable menu, without being 'bar food'...They changed the menu recently - so the food has changed somewhat - mostly for the better! The Johnny Appleseed Chicken Sandwich was very good. Salads are also good choices. They moved all of their wine to a wall, so there is no list - you get up and explore. It's a novel idea - but I wasn't interested in exploring that particular night. They have a back patio, that is often forgotten...so in nice weather, you have a better chance there than at Harris Grill. Service is fine. All in all, it's one of my top picks for an average night out.",2
14962,"I used to hate Carly's. I couldn't see the appeal. The service is always abysmally slow. The seasonal tap is always empty - half the time the servers don't even know what it is supposed to be filled with. The food is... okay. A few of the sandwiches are really good, but the vegetarian and vegan options are pretty bland - when I started eating meat again, I started liking the food here a lot more. The place has grown on me the past couple years, though. They've started hiring some pretty good musicians. The food has been stepped up a little bit. Unlike the Lost Leaf or Roosevelt, the place is big enough to accommodate a healthy crowd without making conversation impossible. I guess I now feel that Carly's is A-OK. Accept the fact that they aren't trying particularly hard, and you'll be able to enjoy the convenience and relatively low price of it all.",2

24172,"I prefer Yogurtland for their superior tasting yogurt and toppings, but U-Swirl is better when meeting friends because they have more seating & space, and also because this location is closer to where I live. Dare I say that this U-Swirl is whimsical? With bright colored furniture and large photos of candy mounted on the walls, I feel like a kid again whenever I go here. I think their yogurt per ounce is pricier than Yogurtland. But I do appreciate some of the unique flavors of their yogurt like Hawaiian Punch. I also appreciate the fact that U-Swirl was started by a local high school student (Green Valley HS). For those of you who didn't know, this location is where U-Swirl all started, and now there are U-Swirls all over Las Vegas & in other states. The service is friendly and the toppings are fresh. I tried the brownie bites, but they just aren't as chewy & delicious as the brownie bites at Yogurtland. I shouldn't mention another frozen yogurt shop's name so many times in my U-Swirl review, but I just haven't found a place that serves better tasting yogurt than my favorite place.",2
46052,"I have been twice now and each time it just gets better and better. I love their garlic edamame and their seaweed salad, so delicious! But the kicker is their Paitan Ramen OH MY GAWD!!!

15105,"This hotel is VERY clean and quiet. I do NOT know why people are complaining about the staff, very nice people who are very willing to help me and my wife. I had the pleasure of dealing with David during check in and he was very nice in helping me get the room i wanted: a suite. I tipped him to begin with and he did all he could to get me a very nice deluxe suite... With NO one else on the floor. I had a room on the fourth floor, very nice. David was even kind and truthful enough to tell me \""you didn't have to tip me\"" but trust me for the room he hooked me up with and the level of service he portrayed, why wouldn't i? Vegas is a city that runs on tips and if you play your cards right, at any hotel, they try to accommodate you the best they can I came here with my wife on Labor Day weekend, and check in and out was a breeze. It's not too far from the strip at all. Don't be put off by the fact there is no casino and it being off strip. It's actually really nice to be able to get up to your room quickly and quietly and sleep without any disturbances. Truly, I would come back to this hotel as it's very clean and the staff is friendly. Good job guys!",4
17684,"My most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category, but thankfully turned into a positive one. The restaurant was only half full, and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a Monday night, they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table. We even offered to be split into two adjacent tables, and still, the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour. So, we contemplated getting takeout, and were about ready to order when miraculously *poof* a table opened up. The service was excellent, and the Big Beef Sandwich was great! Good food, decent atmosphere, although the \""Legalize Marinara\"" T-shirts are a little over the top, especially in a heavy conservative part of town. Anyway, I'll be back. The unique and tasty dishes will ensure that.",4
34952,"Absolutely delicious Thai food offered by a pleasant server. Ordered green curry with extra veggies and tofu and it was so yummy I ate the rest for dinner. My friend had the broccoli chicken and spring roll and she was really impressed. Ambiance is very hole-in-the-wall and kitschy, but that's not why you go. You go for the delicious food and good service, and you won't be disappointed.",3
15463,"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear. Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM. Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want. We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce). Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one). The lady told us they were \""coming right out\"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again. We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings.",3
28968,"Regions is not only a terrible restaurant, but also a terrible business. I worked for the Mill Avenue location for all of two months, when one morning I received a phone call from a coworker explaining that they had closed the restaurant overnight. And of course, if you have seen the AZ TV \""3 on your side\"" segment (http://www.azfamily.co...) then you would know that we literally had to chase the owner down for our paychecks. The food is also pretty mediocre. Very bland, and also inconsistent. If we were out of an ingredient we would just throw something else on it and expect people not to notice. When they did, our manager would give them something free and call it a day. They give out so many free things for mistakes, it's no wonder they couldn't give me a paycheck. The only good thing there is the signature drinks, which are outrageously priced. Oh, and the balsamic vinegar glaze? Yeah, it had a label on it that stated, \"" not sold in california- MAY CONTAIN LEAD.\"" .....cool.",0
5288,"I am not a huge fan, but I have always liked the Steam pots. I went on Sunday after about a 6-8 month hiatus and the quality has really declined. Dinner came with potatoes that were frozen in the middle, and corn on the cob that was 1) not hot and 2) probably old enough to vote. Service was OK. They gave us an $11 credit to address the two bad steam pots and replaced the potatoes and corn. Unfortunately, the replacement items were not seasoned, clearly not fresh, and the corn had some black kernels on it. The crab seemed to also not be as good as it used to be there. Not sure if they just had an off night, but I don't plan to go back.",0
36660,"This wine bar / restaurant was recommended by a local friend, but we had a very bad experience. Summary: Excellent food, decent wine, poor service. My wife and I were seated with menus - and no wine list. At a wine bar. We had to ask for the wine list twice and the waiter, who seemed overwhelmed with everything, said something about having trouble finding one -- at a wine bar. Service was slow and inattentive. After finally getting some wine and ordering some cheeses to start, we ordered four small plates and asked them to be brought out two at a time. We had already been there an hour before we finally got the busy waiter to take our order beyond cheese. Things were taking too long (we had budgeted two hours for wine and food before a concert) and the first small plates were taking too long, we asked to cancel the last two. They tried bringing all four at the same time even though the table wouldn't have been big enough. The place was hardly full at 8 pm yet the waiter and apparently the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. Again, food was excellent and creative - once we actually got it.",1
24187,"I do love the food here, although it is extremely Americanized Sushi. That's to be expected, but this isn't why I gave it two stars. I went for dinner and I thought I had entered a club. The music was loud and thumping, and we literally had to yell to have a conversation. It was during happy hour so I'm not sure if that is why, but all the same it didn't help the experience. I don't mind loud music, but it definitely didn't feel appropriate in this restaurant. I guess I'd go back, but maybe I'll just take someone I don't really want to talk to. ;-)",1
16744,"To start, I'm actually a pastry chef so I may be more critical of their baked goods. Macarons in Arizona that isn't from my kitchen? Of course I had to check it out! I've been to Essence numerous times and well, I don't think I'll be going back unless its on Saturday to buy a loaf of brioche. The place is small so if you go on the weekend, you might have to wait a bit for a table to open up. Their food is good. They boast organic ingredients carefully selected and it was indeed tasty. There are a few things on the menu that is different and I love that they have a different special every day, every week. But there isn't anything on there I couldn't make at home, especially for the price on some of them. The brioche is excellent. I can buy a loaf and eat it for all 3 meals. Very tasty. Croissant left a lot to be desired though. It wasn't a soft, flaky croissant but rather dry and bland. If I buy a croissant, I want it to flake and make a mess and I want to be able to taste the buttery pastry. Not at Essence. The macarons - People, it's MACARON, not macaroon. Huge difference. The flavors are not anything special or unique, just standard flavors you'll see at any French pastry shop. The espresso macaron tastes exactly like tiramisu, vanilla is very good, all the citrus ones are great but chocolate is lacking that chocolatey punch. Their filling can be too warm and runny at times, which is bad for buttercream. There have been times I can tell by looking at it that it's been over baked but I give them the benefit of the doubt and take it home anyway. Big mistake. If it has been over baked for a minute, it won't make a big difference on the texture but unfortunately for me, I've been sold ones so over baked it ended up being a brick on the edges and overly chewy on the inside. Once I was lucky enough to return it but other times, I had to toss it. I have a suspicion that they also sell batches that has been out for more than a day or two judging by the texture and taste. Is it good? Yes. Can you get your macaron fix if you can't make it yourself? Sure. Would I go back? Most likely not.",2
8922,"My Mom and I decided to have a girls day today, starting with massages and ending with Indian food on a whim. My mom said that she hated Indian food, but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago, so we decided to give it a shot. The place is dark and a little run down, but once you get past that it is a decent place. We split the chicken tikka masala thali with garlic naan and a mango lassi. The drink was really tasty and my mom loved it! The chicken was good, but it wasn't as good as I have had it other places and it wasn't that spicy. The sauces that came with it were all pretty good. For dessert it came with a little fried donut thing that was sorta chemically tasting...not my fave. Overall, the place was good, it just didn't measure up to other places I have tried BUT it did change my mom's opinion on Indian food, which is awesome!",2
34694,"I really don't want to have to do this because I've had such amazing experiences at Lebowskis before. But if this had been my first visit I would never be going back. Went for a Saturday night dinner and drinks treat and expected a lot better. I'd have the meat platter before and was craving it so was disappointed when it was no longer on the menu. When I asked the waitress about it I was reassured they still did it, it just wasn't printed on the menu. I happily handed over my money and sat back in anticipation. But what turned up was worse that dreadful. 4 slices of what i can only assume was Salisbury's bread along with a bundle of salmon, a bowl of haggis, bowl of black pudding and the worst over cooked steak I've ever attempted to eat. And that was all. What happened to the salad, the oatcakes, the chicken, the cooking skills??!! Eventually after prompting, the waitress brought me some cutlery and a few slices of lemon from the bar. I don't know what was going on in Lebowskis on Saturday but it was all dreadful. Our table was filthy, as was the one in the next booth. And no one came to clear our table long after we finished eating. I would have been irritated if I'd been told the platter was no longer available but at least that would have been honest. Instead I was fooled into buying a substandard meal. I think Lebowskis need to make up there minds about what they are offering as there customer experience. At the amazing yelp elite event not even a month ago they were all about gourmet, locally sourced food. Cooked to perfection and served in style. That all went out the window on Saturday. Will i go back, maybe. Should you go......? That's up to you.",0
9404,"I went into this Burger King, as I do every day for lunch, to get a quadruple Whopper meal with a King-sized fries and XXL diet Chocolate shake. When I ordered, the person behind the counter took my hard-earned money and came back and gave me what looked like a BIG MAC!!!!!! What the fuck??? If I wanted a nasty, processed, non flame-broiled Big Mac, I'd go to Wendy's. I eat Burger King and ONLY Burger King. So I politely asked the man behind the counter \""What the fucking shit is this, you faggot??? I axed for a Whopper so get your head out of your Mom's cunt and GIVE ME A MOTHERFUCKING WHOPPER NOW!!!!!\"" Just as I was about to throw a molotov cocktail at the fry cook rather than order something else on the menu that is exactly the same as the Whopper, I saw none other than \""The King\"" himself come from behind the counter with my delicious fat-free Quadruple Whopper on a plate made of solid gold. I realized that I was part of a hilarious hidden camera gag and loosened my chokehold on the girl with Down's syndrome who was refilling the ketchup and moved the shard of glass away from her jugular. I chuckled and promptly apologized to the employees and customers who I had scared with my voice-raising and tard-choking and happily took my food to the parking lot to eat in my Honda Del Sol as I do every day. I took my first bite of the Whopper and realized - THERE ARE ONLY THREE PATTIES ON THIS THING!!! By then it was too late to raise another fuss and I had to get back to my job at Chick-Fil-A. I am, however, currently trying to build a super laser so that I can vaporize that Burger King for fucking up my Whopper. I will never forget.",0
9996,"Fun to Play - but not to Stay. You get what you pay for - Harrah's is not the worst place to stay, it's a great price for the location Center Strip, but the rooms, especially the bathrooms are small (though you do get a small balcony if you stay in the Mardi Gras tower. Their check in desk is hands down the slowest in Las Vegas (i've stayed all over the strip, and it's not even close) The hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip. Their pool is super small and has maybe 50 chairs available (great for place with close to 1000 rooms). The spa was just awful, standing water everywhere a sauna that never got hot and a hot tub that all but required quarters to keep it going. On the brightside - Harrah's is a fun place to gamble, the dealers are fun and table mins are low and the cocktail waitresses are on top of thing. Their sports book, while not the biggest is pretty nice as well.",1
37206,"Woo hoo! I can NOT believe I haven't Yelped about this place since we went earlier in 2013! We had a group of six go together (5 adults and 1 child), and it was a blast, and so hilarious. I don't need to say too much more than what's been said already as the descriptions are spot on. But it's one of those places you have to experience for yourself when you're looking for something fun and different. Keep in mind, it is dark and the music is loud. The icing on the cake was when we went in, it was cool and sunny and dry outside. When we opened the doors to leave, we were greeted with the biggest, softest, prettiest snowfall we had ever seen. Snowball fight in the parking lot! Great day.",4
24315,"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn. 20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us. So here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning.",0

I'll start with the bad, and remember, I was there mid-June.

Then return to the other \""bar\"" and bring back your drink you ordered?! Why would I have not just sat at the other bar? Seriously annoyed the hell out of me. Food at all the onsite restaurants I tried undelivered but the catering for our work event was amazing (REALLY good catering for a large group). La Hacienda was overpriced Mexican, and not that tasty. The steakhouse was VERY overpriced and the steak was cooked completely wrong at a 4 DIAMOND steakhouse?!?! Shocked. My room.... amazing. Overlooking the south pool, king size suite that felt enormous. Everything you wanted. Left razor at home, brought to my room right away by housekeeping. VERY nice rooms. Request pool view for sure. AC works great, although the noise of these things always bugs me...just not use to them I guess. Swimming pools, VERY nice. Not overcrowded like the Valley Ho I had stayed at the weekend before to party at. Very clean, lacking a bit in service.... but the drinks were $11 a pop for WELL, so that was better for my companies bottom line.

Emily was equally awesome to work with as she was extremely quick to send me nanny profiles and always responded to my emails promptly. The nanny we decided on is absolutely wonderful and truly is \""a perfect fit\"" for our family. I would definitely recommend this agency to my family and friends. As a matter of fact, I have a friend who just gave birth a week ago and I've already told her this is definitely the place to use.

It was after lunch and the restaurant was very quiet. I was looking up at the menu on the wall, when a very nice young man pointed out the menu was also on the counter. No neck strain necessary. Plus, I can see better. So, I ordered the vegetable skewer plate for $8.50. Initially I thought it was a little pricey until I got home and opened it. The food is stored in a styrofoam container with a large area in front and two smaller areas the back. The large front area was filled generously with very tasty rice. I loved the seasoning, it was delicate and smelled beautiful. Two large vegetable skewers were placed on top, filled from end to end with a variety of grilled veggies like tomato, red pepper, mushroom, red onion. The were cooked perfectly with just a hint of a bite. There was definitely enough for two to share. I'll be back!",3

First, the delivery was fast, free and the delivery guy was super nice and professional. The pizza crust was a good balance between ultra thin crust and deep dish. They don't go too crazy on the toppings and the menu gives tons of options for specialty pizzas. However... the pizzas arrived, how shall I say... less than hot? Kinda luke warm. And just so you know, when you microwave wood fired pizzas, they lose their magic. Also, Roman Candle is on the pricey side. $31 (plus tip!) for two medium pizzas seemed a bit excessive. Perhaps next time I'm in the area I'll try dining in.",2

Service is always prompt, while still being very personable. I got into several interesting conversations the employees. Always love random conversation. The meat is sliced to order. (not sitting between paper, pre-sliced, a la other sandwich shops) Bread is baked fresh. Couldn't ask for more from a sandwich shop, other than slightly lower prices. But then again, if prices get cut quality often gets cut along with it. I'll take a good cold cut sandwich any day when I can watch my meat get sliced and make a new friend.",3

Who doesn't like smart toilets that open and shut for you (no more kicking the lid up with my shoe) and the seat is even heated! Just like the heated seats in my car. There was a whole panel on the wall for more advanced options, which I did not explore but appreciated the possibilities ;) Eating sushi at Geisha is like eating sushi in an Austin Powers movie. Shag carpet, low couches, very retro feeling. Not the best sushi or the best drinks but for the happy hour special prices its very worth checking out! (or just to use the bathrooms) :)",2
45408,"I can't believe some of these reviews are of the same Over Easy I go to every time I'm in Mesa! My food has always been very good, service perfect and cleanliness impeccable! I've tried just about everything on the menu and never had a complaint. OJ is $6.00 because it's fresh squeezed. I mean how many restaurants make their own jam? Over Easy does. People need to understand that small restaurants don't have the buying power of large chains, so of course the prices are higher. My only complaint is they won't build one in Yuma!",4
31443,"BevNoMo! I went to Total Wine on a Saturday. I had no intention of buying anything. I came to drink--- for free! I'm a girl, I should never have to buy myself a drink and at Total Wine, I don't have to because they give you beer and wine samples inside the store! Now I can have all the beer and wine I want without pretending like I'm interested in going home with anyone. You don't have to get dressed up either, ladies. Leave the push up bra and fake eyelashes at home, you won't need them here. Aside from the great freebies, this place is cheaper than BevMo and has more to choose from. It is neatly organized by type of alcohol and I want to say that they use the Dewey decimal system but I'm not sure, I was kind of drunk. I did end up buying some things and because I'm so well preserved, they naturally carded me. But then the manager was called and I thought OMG, they are going to tell me I can't drive home because of how much of the free booze I had. But the manager was only called over to check my ID as well, I guess if you look like you just entered puberty, there is a two-tiered ID checking procedure. By the way, I'm a responsible drinker... I let my brother drive us home since he didn't have any to drink. So Total Wine is the Total Shit.",3
23281,"I'm super white and went here on Latin night. The bar/lounge is beautiful and the lighting and music were spot on. I enjoyed the outside area. The bartenders were fast and friendly and the drinks were strong and priced well. I got here about midnight and some people I talked to said it's busier early, which is strange because midnight is usually when Vegas nightlife is just getting started. That being said, there were lots of hombres and not enough chicas, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars.",3
14324,"Just returned from a stay at the JW Marriot, Desert Ridge Resort and Spa! The room was just a little above average, had an eastern view of the back of the joint, montains in the distance, and golf course on either side. The small, empty fridge, thank you was very noisy though as was the AC system that made noise all night. The TV, 40 inch flat panel was okay except that you could only get maybe a dozen free channels. Free Wifi was so slow as to make it unusable, the only reason it was free was because it was provided by the conference that we were attending. The on site restaraunts were just OK, though I did not get the opportunity to eat at the Roy's that was there. The Steak House at the Golf course did provide an excellent meal, but for a huge price. The pools were large enough to accomodate the overcrowding but the filtration system was not, the water was an icky cloudy grey. And with all of the servants walking around I would have thought it would not have taken 45 minutes to get my Arnold Palmer. Now why just a two star rating, well, the parking lot that was quite a hike from the main entrance was pay only, and the charges were 27 bucks a day for Valet, which I paid anyway. Still nonsecured, uncovered parking for $27. and then in the desert your car is always dusty, so I didn't say too much when it showed up covered, yes covered in bird dooky! The desert is huge why should you have to pay for uncovered parking, it's not like we were in San Francisco. At the very least I would think that my $400 a night could have absorbed a few things like good free internet and free parking. The service was good for the most part, though my bed did not get made one day and I was too tired to call them to make it up when I returned at 10 pm. The Decor, not that I am a decorator, is kind of a hoge podge of Desert meets Hawaii meets English Tea Garden. From the landscaping to the room itself nothing really matched, think early estate sale. All said save your money, there are plenty of less expensive places to stay that still border on a quality Resort and Spa, maybe Hyatt or Westin have something near. I have stayed at the Four Seasons down the road and it was much nicer and less expensive.",1
20155,"This store seems nice, but a manager or supervisor I spoke to about looking for an item I was looking for was beyond rude! I noticed he was spelling it wrong so I asked him to search again using the correct spelling. I was told \"" sir, your wrong. Do you even know how to spell what your looking for\""? Then he walked away without any resolution to my situation. I was clearly an inconvenience to his day and he made that clear. I would much rather go to best buy for my item and pay more.",1
18350,I love how they have everything you need that's from the Philippines and other asian countries. They also have 2 restaurants for you to eat. One is Jollibee and the other is Chow King. The both are good. The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because it's really crowded. I wish they would make this place a little bigger like the Boulevard Mall. The best time to come here is in the mornings not as crowded.,2
43153,"Arrived at 845, closes at 1000. Nowhere near busy. Hostess obviously wasn't happy to be at work. Waited 7ish minutes to have drink order taken by Emily. Waited 5 minutes for the drinks. Finally got our cornbread rolls, the best part, about 15 minutes into our visit....cold. Began hearing the next table over saying they were waiting on refills and the A1 sauce, originally forgotten by the server, was empty. Finished our teas, waited some more for refills. Food arrived fast and hot, at least the kitchen was on point. Didn't wait long for the check. Thanks Emily. Your service as horrible. Kitchen did awesome...minus the cold cornbread, which I'll blame on the server not checking her food service. No bueno Emily.",1
37732,"I'm one of those folks that is super sensitive to high carb/starchy/sugary things so I ordered a caprese burger and ditched the bun. When the waiter saw that I had the bun to the side he mentioned to me that for people that prefer their burgers sans bun they will provide a side salad instead. The burger was 'okay' and the salad was salad (mixed greens). Nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a real 'caprese' taste the caprese burger won't even come close. The waiter kept hitting on me which wasn't appropriate. Quality was definitely not worth the price but it was convenient. It was nice to have the salad in place of the bun, normally the most filling parts of meals are the starch so this substitution was a plus.",1
34785,"This is my new favorite pizza restaurant. I must say the pizza is better than Metro. The pizza is very d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. It doesn't have that fake cheese taste. As I am writing this review, my boyfriend is considering picking up pizza from here. We eat here at least once or twice a week. My favorite the cheese pizza, great price. Highly recommend trying this place out. Spread the word about this restaurant.! You definately will not be disappointed.",4
15369,"We eat at this deli many years ago inside the Mirage Hotel and remember it was really good. With our recent visit I was so disappointed. The server lady had no idea what the soup of the day was. She was kind of nutty in her response and made us feel like she was in a hurry. Much to my disappointment the food was horrible- we sent it back because it was cold. I also found the prices to be out of line with the lack of quality. With so many options in Las Vegas, I would not plan on returning to this place. They nickle and dime you.",1
23376,"My husband and I ended up at Table 10 by chance while wondering around the Palazzo trying to find a place for dinner. The good news is that most people eat dinner super late on the strip, so we had no trouble getting a table at a normal dinner hour (around 6:00 P.M.). Service was a bit slow at first but then got better. They were not busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was. I'd say we waited a good ten minutes to order drinks. After that there was a dramatic improvement. I have mixed reviews to offer on the food. I expected a better cocktail sauce to be served with the oysters. In fact, we had much better oysters at a more reasonable price the next day at the Palace (right off the strip). My husband's salmon was out of this world excellent--the best I've ever tasted. On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special. That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing. My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor. Thankfully, I was saved by dessert. We ordered and scarfed down the White Chocolate Malassadas, which are little donuts with white chocolate on the inside and cinnamon sprinkled on the outside. Oh . . . my . . .God!!!! Yes, they were THAT good.",3
41857,"I LOVE PIZZA!!! My friend and I ordered a pepperoni pizza for carry out. The pizza was sooo good! I love the crust, it's thick and buttery. I do have other favorite pizza places, but for the price this is awesome food. I'd order again.",3
45863,"My wife and I came for dinner at about 8 PM on a Friday night. There was live music and the place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away and had a great time. The service, beer, food, and music were all top notch and I am looking forward to a time to return. I had a sampler of six beers, but sent for a seventh, which left five beers on the menu untasted. All were very good, but my the Octomalt and the Diogenes IPA were my favorites. The N.I.B (imperial stout) was dubbed \""not for the feint of heart\"" and they meant it. It hit with a punch thought I'm glad I tried it. The beer list did not match the beer list on their website but I think that is a good thing. It suggests to me the list changes often and the 12 beers on the list that night spanned several styles. I was impressed. We had the wedge salad which was very good but we missed the red onions. We also split the steak sandwich and fries (blue cheese sauce on the sandwich) and enjoyed it very much. Just the right combination of savory and spicy (there were some tiny red peppers that made my head sweat). For desert we split the sundae on a spent grain cookie. It was very good, though we could not finish it. They have a weekend brunch and I am looking for a Sunday afternoon to return! This place has a cool vibe, good food, and great beer. Don't miss it!",4
32260,My little dog had her first vet visit here last night. The Vet was amazing with her. My dog can be very shy at first and the vet and nurse were very patient. They worked with us to find the right plan for our dog and didn't pressure us to buy anything that was not needed. The front desk staff was also very kind and understanding. It seems like the vet is more concerned about my dog than my doctor is about me! We will be going back here again for all our dog needs!,3
39901,I had a great cupping and deep tissue massage with Elliot. He was very professional and listened to what I wanted him to work on. The atmosphere was very soothing and it smelled fantastic. The price is cheap considering the care and great service. I'm planning on being a regular customer!,4
41498,"Went there to ask for prices. The girl at the front desk was very nice but seemed shy and not so confident. I know you just recently opened, but please be more confident and have your prices straight. Even if you have deals going on, it might help if you a have your regular prices listed. I was just very confused with what she was telling me. I also told her we have a black lab and she didn't seem to know what kind of a dog that was. Please do some research about different dog breeds, at least the most common ones. In a pet grooming business this is the least of knowledge you should have. I wish you best of luck with the business and I will update my review after actually using their services.",2
18650,"This is my regular Costco for the last few years. Nothing really sets this one apart form most of the others. Very seldom do they run out of the ordinary stuff I get. Being just one of me there is a limit to what I buy in bulk. One gripe: they do not carry cigarettes any more except at the business center and they haven't carried MGD for many years. Their meat selection may not be the lowest price in town but it is always good quality. The lighting on the signage is poor and it is hard to find the first time at night From 79th. Last night I decide to \""dine\"" there before shopping. I liked the hot dog with soda. It looks like the soda dispensers have options for just water and carbonated water. The pizza slice was sort of greasy and limp, I chose the pepperoni because that is the one that had just come out of the oven as my turn in line came up.",2
28865,"Falls under expectations. Front desk staff is indifferent, feels like I'm at Target. I called in regards to a room change because ours smelled like acidic vinegar, and they said they'll either bring up fans or to come back down. Down we go, to find another huge line. I asked a front desk attendant who I should be talking to, he was rude in telling me the front desk lady I spoke to doesn't exist and he directed me to wait in the corner for his manager. Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me. No one took a moment to apologize for the inconvenience. Upon getting my new room key card, I realized the whole floor smelled like vinegar. Upon entering, the room feels like a Marriott Springfield Suites, you know one of those business extended stays, but no coffee machine :T If you're looking for a no-smoking, no casino hotel, I recommend the Trump, with a great view looking down from the north strip.",0
43748,"I brought my car to Clean Freak today. When I got out, the car looked like it was never washed. Although I paid for the 5.00 wash, I expected my car to be a least clean when it came out.

37544,Usually a good place to eat. I generally pop in on occasion for breakfast. Today I needed to get breakfast so I could give blood this morning. I arrived shortly before 7:00 and the cook was still not there. They open at 6:00. I left about 7:05 with no food or cook. They should just close for the day if this is their only cook. I did wonder why there were only three customers there when I arrived usually at that time of day.,0
31557,"Been going to discount tire since I started driving at the age of 16. (11 years ago this month) I have never had a problem with them. I usually go to the shop on Tropicana and Jones but I live in southern highlands now so I go to the blue diamond rd store. I took my car in there last month for tires. I was met by the assistant manager, a young man mid 20s or so I believe his name was Mark. He gave me the info I needed and the tires I needed for my car and the experience was great and quick. Went back last week cause my truck has felt like it has a rock or something in my tire and it is veering off to the left pretty bad as well as tire rotation was needed now anyways. I get to discount tire on blue diamond rd and once again met by Mark or w/e the assistant managers name was and he remembered me got to talking about football a bit since my truck is decked out in GB Packer stuff and he ended up being a Vikings fan. (Go figure) After he looks at my tires he tells me my tires are to big for my rims. ( I have 24 inch rims) I think nothing of it and say great how much to get the proper tires. We go back inside he gets me a couple quotes on tires. $1,400.00 for 4 new tires to fit my rims or $1,200.00 for new rims and tires. I say let me think about it. Week later (today) I take my truck in to Georges Alignment and brakes, less then a hour goes by and I get a call from them. Turns out my alignment is fine as well as my tire balance is okay. My front right tire is ready to separate though as they put it. I have a defective tire with a good amount of tread left but cracks and rip right on the edge of the tire that is visible if you are looking at the tires up close. (which I never did/do thats why I usually go to discount tire). Some how the assistant manager Mark was able to look at my truck for a good 10-15 minutes and not see the cracks or the piece of tire that is flapping. He somehow noticed that my tires were to big even though they have been there since 2011 and the truck was checked out by Towbin Dodge and the Chopper himself before I bought it just to be safe since I did buy the truck used. I should not of even been driving the truck the tire is so bad. Thankfully Georges Alignment and Brake people were smarter then this so called assistant manager of a tire store or I could be driving my truck on the freeway right now and have a major blow out and possible accident with injury or death because the Blue Diamond rd discount tire store decided to promote a young incompetent assistant manager who isn't even paying attention to his job and is only focused on making sales instead of the safety of the customer. I have thought about calling the Higher ups at discount tire but that will most likely do no good what so ever so I will let everyone know my experience there and why I would not recommend ever going to this discount store. I was able to also get 2 new tires from of Towbin fiat for around $350.00 out the door while Discount Tire wanted $350.00 for a single tire.",0
459,"This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said \""NO! It's $60!\"" That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night",0

12825,"Stayed here this past weekend for 5 days/4 nights . FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!) Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would. Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very \"" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying. Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI? Room was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size. Halls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view. The entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)",1
10004,"THIS HOTEL SUCKS. We decided to stay an extra night in Vegas and booked a room at the Harrahs because the Harrahs in Lake Tahoe is awesome. This place is the complete opposite. It took 30+ minutes to check in, ~20 minutes to valet and get our bags to the room. This place is extremely understaffed. The toilet didn't work when we finally got to the room and the cups were extremely dirty. Wouldn't stay here again. Ever. On top of that att signal barley works and the damn made came at 9 am knocking on the door. Cars in the parking lot get hit and broken into and all I heard were car alarms all night . This place needs major help. The room was $109 online but with service fees it ended up being $160. Stay somewhere else, anywhere else.",0
13628,"One of my all time favorite places to eat. I don't get in here nearly often enough, but that is probably best, if I want to keep wearing the same sized pants. I am a huge fan of the \""Standard Classic Burger\"" here. It is fresh simplicity, at it's best. A hot, greasy burger on a fresh bun and tons of good fixings.....I go back here again and again. Pair this up with a \""grocery basket\"" of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato), and you've got yourself a great meal. I always order extra sides of their \""fresh aioli\"" sauce, which ultimately finds itself all over my burger, as well as my fries. A quick note on their signature \""delux burger\""....very good and I love that it's served on a demi-bagette, but the maytag and gruyere cheeses are just a bit much for me. I'm not a big blue cheese guy, and I think it just overpowers the burger. But, if strong cheese is your thing, order away....they don't call it the \""delux burger\"" for nothing! One last comment that you may not know about delux......they serve until 2:00 AM. So, after a night of power drinking, divert your taxi to Camelback & 32nd Street for the ultimate anti-hangover gut bomb. Expect to wait for a seat. I've found the wait at 1:30 AM is as long, if not longer, than it is during lunch!",3
48888,"My wife and I were out shopping on Saturday and as is our custom we were looking for a new and interesting lunch spot. She spotted Hiromaru Fusion Ramen and said \""That's it!\"". The simple yet colorful decor was bright and refreshing compared to some ramen houses I have been in. The waitress was quick to bring our drinks and explain some menu items to my wife. I ordered the TATE-YAMA RAMEN which was truly a mountain of vegetables, sprouts, and delicious ramen. My wife ordered TONKOTSU CURRY TSUKEMEN and it looked and smelled delicious. Both dishes were beautifully prepared and presented. We only had the ramen dishes listed but saw many other interesting meals being served to our fellow diners. We will visit again to try out other menu items! Highly recommend Hiromaru Fusion Ramen for a great meal with a little twist.",4
19291,"I love Thai food it is probably my favorite cuisine and I also enjoy trying new places. I was sadly and sorely disappointed in Thai Corner. I went with my mom and we always order an appetizer entrees which we share then have enough for lunch the next day. The food looked amazing but I guess looks can be deceiving. I might as well have been eating plain noodles with steamed broccoli that is how bland the food was. Our appetizer (I can't remember the name) was an awkward concoction of deep fried noodles and some other unrecognizable fried things. The panang curry was soupy and lacked any of the depth or flavor of a true panang. The pad see ewe was like overcooked noodles with a little soy sauce and some mushy carrots. The food was so bland that I had to add soy sauce to give it a little flavor and when the waitress/owner saw me doing this she actually yelled at me telling me her food did not need soy sauce to which I replied, \"" well I guess you have never tasted your food then.\"" There is no reason to visit this establishment as 5 R Chas is only about a mile away and have far superior food to Thai Kitchen. So yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to the bland food and rude staff.",0
2953,"I am going to be the party-pooper here and say that my visit was only so-so. My brother and I both ordered here and neither of us finished our meals. Maybe... we just weren't that hungry. With that said, maybe I just don't know good (real) Asian food when I have it in my mouth? This could be the case... or my brother and I both got bad batches. After all, we did stumble in about 15 minutes before they were closing (which generally doesn't make the cooks happy). The owner however was super nice. Actually, absurdly nice. He had a demeanor that had us both walking out going... \""could that guy be any more calm?\"" Seriously though, I've never met someone so peaceful. Seeing as how we had never been there the owner also whipped out a little picture book with all the stuff they serve. It was nice for us two un-cultered folks. With all this said, would I go again? Not really unless I was right there and someone else wanted to go.",2
38664,"Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, is it really so hard to put the hollandaise on the side? That's what I asked for but that's not how my benedict came to me. Set in front of me with no apology like I just have to eat it this way or nothing. And that avocado mush - what is that? No flavor added to the bennie at all. Whatever - There won't be any more chances here. Really sorry - I tried to like you.",0

Everyday the offer a coffee cake (instead of toast if you prefer) & it is never the same flavor. Its nice to have something different everyday, You can also get all egg white at no extra charge. I highly recommend this place. My son only wants to eat here for breakfast. Which is fine by me.",3
20362,"Quite possibly the worst chipotle location ever. The staff is lazy and slow. They consistently have you repeat your order because they can't remember 3 ingredients. They argue with each other and you can tell they don't work well together. The wait is outrageous pretty much any time of day! I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I have not waited less than 20 minutes. Even today the line was only 5 people long and it took 20 minutes because they kept running out of stuff. I absolutely love chipotle and the food here is no exception in that regard. my bowl was delicious as always but there are dozens of chipotles in the area here so why bother with this awful location? They probably don't even read these reviews because they don't care about their guests. The cash girl was busy flirting with an employee not working. The black guy on grill was busy watching everyone coming through the door instead of preparing for the rush. (they ran out of rice, hot sauce, beans, and chicken while I was here. 15 minute wait for chicken!) Look for another chipotle to eat at! It's great food but 0 star service here.",0
16112,"DNG is very comfortable and, excluding Fridays and Saturdays, it's always easy to get a table. The club sandwich is tall and tasty and the seasoned fries are awesome. Service is a little slow at times but always friendly. Sunday brunch draws a huge church crowd, so yes, it's packed. But as of March, I noticed they now serve brunch 7 days a week. The omelets are great. Bacon can be a little undercooked. (Which seems to be a North Carolina thing because I can't get truly crispy bacon anywhere except at diners.) And their grits look like cheese grits but they aren't, and they're still really good.",3

It was so embarrassing having a drink with my parents who are older and watching them try to hang out and have a conversation and do nothing but swat flies for an hour and a half. And our server handed us our food and drinks over the brick wall ledge in the lounge area yesterday instead of walking around and placing it on our table. I got up out of my seat to get the plates and napkins he brought and my Mom had to turn around and get their chips and guacamole.",1
40362,"This place is going downhill. Very inconsistent. I like that it's closer to me, but it's really not worth it after my last experience. Went there for Chinese New Year dim sum with my family. Was told by female manager that there was still a lot of variety going around, but it turns out a number of our favorites were missing. Pork in all the dishes was very white, like they forgot the soy sauce or something. Meat & shrimp were not sticking together at all in the Siu Mai. Noodles were bland. Very inattentive and poor customer service. The male manager walked by, and I started talking to him when his cell phone rang. He answered the call promptly without excusing himself, walked away, and never came back. I thought it was very rude of him. Better to make the trek to Chinatown for dim sum done right at either Orchids Garden or Ping Pang Pong.",1
42612,"I give 1 star to the super nice waiter. Other than that, let me tell you why it doesn't get any stars from me. I know you may be thinking I'm biased because I'm Vietnamese and can get home-cooked pho. However, I do eat at other Vietnamese restaurants too and this was the first time I've ever come across the worst tasting pho of my life. What I ate: beef spring roll (goi cuon) and the meatball pho (pho bo vien). 1. The food is pricey compared to most restaurants. $7-$9 for a bowl of pho. You can find much, much better pho for $5-$6 a bowl. 2. The spring roll: the beef was dry and was more like steak meat cut up and put into it. Usually, you find spring rolls with shrimp and/or pork. 3. The pho: when it came out, I tasted just a bit of the broth because that's the most important part of pho. It was sweet! I've never in my life had pho that was pre-sweetened. It baffled me that they would even bother bringing out the hoisin sauce. That's what the hoisin sauce is for: to provide some sweetness to the soup's broth. It was like drinking sugar water. I had to ask for some fish sauce to try and balance the sweetness. They brought me a little sauce bowl for it and I dumped the whole thing into the soup - it didn't help. If anyone's tried fish sauce, they understand how salty it is. I could only eat the meatballs. I couldn't stomach the rest. I'm shocked at how upset I am by how poor the food tasted. I'm offended that people will come into this restaurant thinking that this is representative of Vietnamese food. I'd rather go to Unphogettable, Da Vang, or Phu Thanh any day. Please save your money, taste buds, and stomach - don't go here!",0

12654,"Just checked out this morning after a 4 night stay. This is a solid hotel but next time I will stay elsewhere, probably the Bellagio. The standard rooms are spacious but as others have said here, the bathrooms are TINY. Closet is very small, too. The bathrooms are about 5' wide (just wide enough for double sinks) and about 8-9' long. Tub is just a standard crappy tub with a curved shower bar. There are nicer bathrooms in low end Marriotts. The beds were comfy and it's a plus that they had two queens in a room and not doubles. Overall the hotel and casino feel a little run down and the clientele leaves a bit to be desired. I think the Mirage's best days are over.",2
13077,Stayed here 9/11/13 - 9/16/13. Not our first time in Vegas but 1 st time staying here. We arrived about 2:30 pm shuttle drops you off across street do to construction but was not a bad walk maybe a block in a half. Long lines at check in but I'm a platinum member so you skip the long lines the girl checking us in was very polite and was smiling and very quick and we were on our way to room. Our room one of our keys worked when we got there one did not. Room was great on the 26th floor had a view of the strip. Room was very clean bed super comfy. tv in bathroom mirror . It was the room we booked :) had a fridge and coffee maker. shower was awesome great water pressure and got very hot. had maid service everyday and they did a great job always left clean towels cleaned roomed etc. there was construction on that side of building but they were not out there late or real early and not on Sunday. had no problems with that. Walls are thin though could hear the people next door they had there music loud first night but hey it's Vegas ...lol. So keys after unpacking we went back down to desk and did not have to wait in line and very nice girl gave us two new keys and they both worked through out rest of stay. Now the elevators OMG they are old and scary the creaked and shook and made load noises. they also we slow had to wait pretty long for them. the one time going down to casino from our floor one opened we got in it started to beep real loud and would not move and doors would not open back up was totally scared finally doors opened we rushed out and waited for another one. So Flamingo Please Please fix these worn out elevators. Casino we stayed here for two reason I'm a Big Jimmy Buffett fan so Margaritaville and casino are here and center strip. We always love Margaritaville and there casino. The flamingo casino is very confusing layout. The restaurants we ate at Paradise Cafe food was good and service was good. food court ok for a fast bite although Johnny Rockets staff did not seem to know what they were doing. Paradise Buffet was good lots of food was very good. So would we stay here again .........no we like to stay at different places every time we come to Vegas.,2
13698,"I came here for lunch on Sunday and for some reason they did not have any crab legs. How can you not serve crab legs?? Every time I go to a buffet, I must eat the prime rib. And their prime rib was OK. A few things that stood out were the lobster ravioli, shrimp and peso pizza, and the french toast station. They have a big dessert section. But no cones for ice cream!",2
44402,"We dined here this evening with my daugher's dance studio being located in the same plaza. We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening. It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :( We had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order. We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful. The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture. The sauce was standard and was just the right amount. The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning. My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap. Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley. Deco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables. Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night. The service was really slow, they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout. It was super clean, a positive for me :) I may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish. I am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously.",1
27032,"While visiting from the US we stopped in for a few drinks - and were ignored. The bar was virtually empty, maybe 8 guests but it was early. We walked in, I said hello to the male bartender, he made complete eye contact and turned his back on us so we sat at a table. I finally had to walk up and ask the female bartender if they had table service or if we ordered from the bar. Not a friendly lot, really - and pretentious for no reason. I'll gladly spend my cash elsewhere during my stay in Edinburgh and would discourage other tourists from bothering to stop in here...unless you like being ignored and treated like a bother",0
30869,"We came here on a Sunday evening in summer, on a double date with some friends. We made a reservation, but there were a handful of tables to spare for walk-ins. We were seated outside in their garden, which is a lovely patio decorated with little lights, and covered in flowering plants. It feels secluded and private, and it's easy to forget that there are other patrons around you. We brought two bottles of wine, which our served opened for us - even brought us an ice bucket for the white wine. It's only $1 a glass to BYOB which is a pretty sweet deal. Service isn't speedy, but it's definitely at a relaxing pace. You have time to swallow your appetizers before your entree shows up, and nobody slams the check down next to you when half of your pad thai is still on the plate. Gotta love that. We started with the Grilled Pork Meatballs - four of them come skewered on sugar cane and they are delicious! Juicy and succulent and flavorful. They didn't come with a \""dipping sauce\"" as advertised, but there was a little bit of sauce drizzled over them, so maybe that's what they meant? For my entree, I got the Spicy Duck Noodles at a level 5, which ended up being the perfect spice level. It was definitely spicy, giving my mouth a kick, but I wasn't sweating and gasping and diving for my water glass. I'd get food at a level 5 here again next time - I like being able to feel the heat without my taste buds getting too numb to get the other flavors. The duck was tender, the broth was savory, and the noodles were slurpable. Not much veg in the dish, but it was very tasty nonetheless - super fresh, and I actually finished the whole thing! I ate it so happily that I didn't have even remember to taste my boyfriend's Massaman Curry, which he said was delicious as well. I think Pusadee's and Kanok are really on par with each other - great, fresh Thai in a beautiful setting. Worth the money for sure. It's several steps above your average Thai takeout, and I hope we'll return to Pusadee's again before the summer is over - that outdoor patio is just fantastic!",3
15144,"Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis, hmm... And so the Vegetarian's came out that night. We were hungry. We were on a mission to find Veggie-friendly food. It was late. We were tired. We wanted, well, food! We ended up skimming the menu which had a good variety of food. Steak, Prime Rib, Breakfast options, Soups, Salads etc... The only thing that seemed veggie friendly was the Pasta. My friend asked if they had (off menu) a vegetarian sandwich of some sort. Low & behold, we were informed that they did. A veggie-sandwich which comprised of eggplant, mushrooms, bell peppers and more. Sided with either fries or a baked potato. Wow! Sounded tasty. When our dish came out, it looked fabulous. Yes, it was exactly how it was described to us but it was hard to control since all the actual vegetables were flying out of my breaded envelope. I couldn't control these suckers. I ended up forking the vegetables and swooshing my bread to the side. Had it swooped me off my feet with taste, I might've thought otherwise. I see the effort in making an off-the-menu veggie friendly dish, and I acknowledge that, but it just wasn't dish presentable. This place gets an \""A\"" for effort, but a decent ''C\"" for veggie presentation. :)",2
27126,"Maxies doesn't look much from the outside, and to be honest, it isn't up to all that much inside either. Situated just round the corner from the Royal Mile, Maxies is right behind Edinburgh Castle and so it ought to be a great restaurant for all the tourists to go, but unfortunately it is not up to much. The restaurant has quite a cosy feel inside with padded seats covered in cushions, with a pretty lively atmosphere. The menu in Maxies is pretty much seafood orientated, with lots of fish and seafood dishes, but there are also steaks, stir fry's, chicken and haggis dishes on the menu too. I had the sole cooked in a creamy sauce, which was OK. The sauce was pretty thick and gloopy and lacked proper taste, but the fish was perfectly cooked. My friend had a pasta dish which they really didn't like, she said the pasta was still hard and that the sauce was tepid - not nice. The service was pretty average too, the waiter's weren't that attentive and only seemed to show some life when we asked for the bill. There are much better restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of the custom than Maxies.",1
26276,"The cheap and good burger bar place. Gem of the Atwood area. AWESOMO. I love the beef thingies like burger, steak sandwich etc etc, chicken thingy was good and fish thingy was good. Lol, I'm terrible at names, but hey they change the menu often enough. Get the sweet potato fries here, awesome dips and HOW do they make it so tasty!?!?! Just a note, the normal fries give the same goodness but are made of normal potatoes. The wasabi peas, ooooohhhhhh good. Seriously, not very spicy but full of flavor. And my newbie today, quinoa salad, WOOOHOOOOO. My dish tonight was FANTASTIC. I've never had a better steak anywhere. I had the daily special honey and bourbon steak sandwich. Flavors were bursting in my mouth, the steak was so nice and chewy, and it has the cream cheese I love, reminding me of Bob's bad breath. mmmmm mmm mmmmmm. I usually have only half a burger, but I'm proud to say I FINISHED IT ALLLLLL. Other favorites of mine are stuffed grilled cheese and the regular menu burgers, all done really well! My man had the pineapple BBQ ribs, the flavor was top notch, but the ribs wasn't fat enough, so it wasn't soft and chewy.. Bring some cash, come on by (if you forget, there's an ATM). Might be crowded, even on weekdays, but its worth the wait!!!",4
37634,"5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service. My fellow Yelpers, you did not disappoint. My friend and I came here after reading reviews on Yelp. We always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. I had the Billionaire Burger, and yes, it is DEFINITELY worth the $28!! After California banned foie gras, I was heart broken. I didn't know when I will be able to eat it again, so when I saw the Billionaire Burger on the menu, I had to get it! This burger is made with kobe beef, FOIE GRAS, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. This burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. I usually get cheese on my burgers, but I opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. If you absolutely need some cheese, I'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. When the burger was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. There was a HUGE piece of grilled foie gras on my burger. I was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, I was wrong. The foie gras was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. There was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! You definitely get the bang for your buck here. The burger came with a choice of shoestring fries (which I recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. Another tip. If you check in with Foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. I don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. For the service, it was just non existent. Our server took so long to take our orders. We sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. I think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. All in all, yes, I definitely felt like a Billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger I had in my life! I can't wait til I go to Vegas again.",3
43346,"You ever feel so embarrassed for someone you want to crawl under the table for them? That pretty much sums up this experience. There was nothing \""awesome\"" about this. My friend had free tickets so I agreed to go, I am very hesitant to pay for any shows coming out of Planet Hollywood because most are a waste of money. Let me tell you, if I paid $49.99 for this crap I would have been livid. We were all pretty excited to see this show as we didn't really know anything except it was supposed to be interactive kinda like Tony & Tina's Wedding except for no food is served. So we enter the \""showroom\"" I\""m putting quotes around the because it was literally a room that was divided in half, possibly the other side is being used for a different show? The decorations were clearly from Party City and made to look like a high school auditorium with a prom theme. The actors were all attempting to be a character out of all the famous 80's movies, but it was a very poor attempt. Basically the idea of this show was you are at prom, you vote for prom king and queen and you are supposed to interact with the actors. Now I use the word actors loosely because I've seen better plays put on when I was in junior high school in the dreaded drama class I was forced to take. In our group there were 10 of us, within 15 minutes we all wanted to leave, but being there was only about 25 people at the show, we didn't want to leave all at once because it would have been noticable and we didn't want to get harassed. Speaking of harassing, that's all that was happening. Now I'm not a wallflower and I like to get down with 80's music just as much as the next guy, but I don't want to be followed around and pretend that I'm enjoying interacting with the people when I'm really not. Very little seating, very small bar, with minimal choices, the DJ and security guy walking around were giving me the creeps as well dressed all in black/goth type drama club. I wouldn't come back nor would I recommend.",0
22259,"For as much hype as this place got from my friends I was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when I ate here. Instead what I got was a wait in a place with limited AC in AZ in the sumer for what was essentially a ton of different meats that weren't seasoned much thrown on a bun. While the torta I got, the del-rey, wasn't bad it also wasn't fantastic. It tasted like what it was a hodge-podge of meats one would find in mexican food all thrown on a bun. It was hard to distinguish any significant flavors and the one I got the most was that of hot dogs. I probably would have held this place up a bit higher if I hadn't gone to a torta place near work a few days later and had a very similar sandwich that actually had some distinct flavor and I didn't have to wait with little AC for it. I might try this again if I lived closer but I am not driving out of my way for this.",2
28720,"I've never had any desire to be here. I actually had no idea it was a place to be. I didn't even know where it was to be honest... I had just heard about it... just that it existed by name. Nothing more. Had I seen the reviews here before going, I might not have even bothered. A friend of mine was working the whole Fashion Week thing and somehow scored us these amazing $400 all-access VIP Super Passes to the whole thing including the after party held at the W. The downtown area was a traffic congestion nightmare so it took awhile to get a place to park. They were holding a red velvet rope line show at the main entrance to the hotel where all the cars pull up. So elegant and fancy. We waited outside amidst the fumes and fancy rides for our turn to enter with our super passes for what seemed like forever. Alas, it was not meant to be as the guy at the door (read: giant useless turd in a suit) finally told my lady friend that he can only let girls in that don't have guys with them... and apparently only if they pass a certain age, boob job, slutty dress set of standards that only exist in this guy's head. Some guys were getting in, but only models from the show pretty much. I tried to convince my friend to just leave so we could go someplace I actually like, but she was wanting to prove a point on principal. She confronted him a few times about his being a soulless anus, but he didn't wouldn't change his position about us. I should've stepped in and said \""look - we've been standing here long enough - either let us the hell in or tell us we aren't welcome here even with our $400 all-access VIP super passes so we can fuck off to someplace better where we don't have to look at your shitty face, you hack.\"" In the end our time was wasted. Elitism won and we finally gave up since there was only an hour left of the night and the line had dwindled to only a few dozen people unfit to enter the exclusive party. My friend was too upset to salvage the energy to go to another place. She actually was over the whole Scottsdale thing and insisted that this was representative of the whole city - I was unable to assure her it wasn't (but I assure you it isn't). We hugged a sad goodnight right there in the W carport and went our separate ways. It's easy to say I didn't really want to be in there in the first place - well, I really didn't. I was just interested in having a drink with a friend and catching up. The W just wasn't meant to be the venue to host such an event. I never got to see the inside from the inside, but I'm pretty sure it smelled like shit covered in puke in there and was likely covered in some sort of sticky film that only drips off of the most hoity of toity. It's not that I'm jealous because I was already hanging out with all these same fake assholes at Fashion Week an hour earlier - I don't know that a change of scenery would really make them that much more compelling and interesting. In fact, I'm sure it wouldn't. It's just that I don't like places that judge you worthy or unworthy of coming in. It's demoralizing and insulting. Even if they had let us in, I would've felt the same way. Pretentiousness is next to ugliness. If I had actually paid $400 for that VIP Super Pass and not been let in to the party immediately, I'd be pretty livid. Since it was free, I can't be that mad - but the rope guy didn't know I got the passes for free. We were dressed nice and we're all fairly attractive people. Maybe I'm too old or too fat or didn't have on an Ed Hardly or Affraction shirt. Maybe this dude just didn't like the cut of my jib. No telling why for sure, but I certainly wouldn't have waited more than 5 minutes if it wasn't for my friend wanting to get in. It's just not something I do. So I didn't get to see the inside of this place from the inside - just the car port with the parade of Escalades, sports cars and exhaust fumes. I'm sure it's pretty nice in there, but the only thing I'm willing to wait in line for that long is Space Mountain at Disneyland. I'm pretty sure there's nothing nearly as great inside this shallow pit of pseudo cool as fucking Space Mountain. Blow me, W... you $#&@",0
48100,"As Arizonans, we long to eat something that comes from the mysterious pools of water that surround the globe. Closest I've been to a pool of water bigger than my bathtub is Tempe Town Lake - where I sometime contemplate whether I should throw myself in because all we have is Red Lobster and ... yeah, that's it. Can't afford Joe's Crab Shack? Here's your plan B. I wasn't expecting much as it's in a empty-plaza and of all places, right next door to kid-germ infested Jambo. I went for Sunday dinner and asked for a table of two. The 2 hostess' at the front whose job is to just stand around and act like an extra on the set of Clueless told me that I had to wait until my entire party arrived. The place is only half-filled. I understand this policy at restaurants, but I'm just a party of 2 - not the freaking Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade coming through. When my friend finally did come, I stood in front of the 2 hostess' and we awkwardly stood there facing each other, until I realized that they weren't going to do anything until I spoke up. I was already annoyed about not being able to sit down in a half empty restaurant and now I'm speaking to robots? Service is a little scattered. Servers are assigned tables but I feel like every server just walks around aimlessly. They often came up and asked us if we had already been helped 3 times each throughout the night. Every table had to wait a little while until they were even recognized as having just sat down with no menus or water. Kind of have to wave someone down and tell them what you need. Good thing they have flat screens all around to watch and pass the time. Food - Pretty good and prices aren't too shabby either. My friend ordered the clams and shrimp while I ordered Snow Crab legs. I was expecting small pieces of shrimp, but the sizes exceeded my expectation and were pretty big in my opinion. My friend had the trifecta and spiciness really is hit or miss. You could order medium and it'll feel like the depths of hell in your mouth and sometimes it's barely there. I ordered the garlic, which was pretty good and probably soaked with tons of butter, but mah belly doesn't mind some baby fat. Snow crab legs were of decent size too, not like the skinny anorexic crab legs you get at the casino buffet. Wish they came with sides instead of having to pay extra though. They ran out of utensils to help you with cracking, so the server gave me a rock. That was something new. All in all, if you're wanting some seafood and a new experience while on a budget, come here. I'd rather save up my money and go to Joe's where I can get better service, more portions, and sides altogether for an extra 6 dollars. I'll come back again once more where hopefully, the service has improved. Ask for a marker and sign your name away on the wooden walls.",2
41003,"I've been going to hot n juicy for a couple years now. I go monthly to twice a month. I was a little biased, but the staff at Boiling Crab won me over. You basically order your seafood of choice, pick a sauce, then pick a heat level. I like how they have their own cups and bags for to go food. It's a nice touch. We had a server, Shelly, who was delightful. She pretty much waited on our party of about 7 alone. She checked on us frequently, refilled our drinks often, and we never had to look for her. The food was good. I got a lb of shrimp in the whole she-bang. This is their three sauces mixed together. It was good over all but I thought it lacked in citrus flavor. I'll definitely get lemon pepper next time as a squirt of lime really made the sauce taster for my pallet. I also had some calamari, sweet potato fries, lemon pepper fries, and Cajun fries. It was a cool option to choose spice level on the Cajun fries. I also took some gumbo the go which was delicious. Overall I enjoyed my first time at boiling crab. Would I return? Yes. The staff I encountered all seemed happy, our server did a great job, and my food was comparable to hot n juicy.",3

26882,"So somewhere in the center of the corporate bagel universe the baker demigods got together and decided that some bagel chains would be better priced for bagels with just a basic spread- like cream cheese or peanut butter, while others would get the price break for bagels with, aka the breakfast sandwich. Why else would a some bagel shops charge $1.50 for the bagel with spread, while the others go for $2.00 plus? And still others charge $4.00 for a bagel with egg and cheese, while other do it for $2.00? Brueggers, as a chain, was blessed with the breakfast sandwich advantage, and they do it well. Not only can you get an egg o'bagel for under $3.00, but you can also add spinach, mushrooms, and other fresh veggies to it for just a few shekels more. This is not possible at your other corporate bagel stops. If a bagel with a spread won't do, Bruegger's is a better bet. Add to that the fact that this store is just a doorway away from a Carribou's Coffee and this is breakfast made in heaven. Sadly, though, I am not alone in this assessment as both sides can be quite full on weekend mornings. This even holds true for the outside patio tables during warmer weather, where people watching is at a premium. Sadly this can making parking a challenge too, though CMC's lot next door has helped out. The other challenge is, as mentioned by others, cleanliness of the place. Staff are apparently too busy serving new customers and ringing them up, as late mornings look something like a post-locust plague landscape in terms of trash and spills left along table tops. A little gross, but easy to fix. Weekday mornings can be just as tricky with parking, but folks are so much sitting around and drinking in the morning. Great deal on a baker's dozen bagels on Wednesdays, which always makes you popular back in the office.",2
40742,"I should heed the warning...don't go to sandwich shops for their anniversary special! Schlotzskys has turned 40...and they had an offering of a small original sandwich for $1.99. In the growing up years, Schlotzskys held a special place in my world. Their bread was fresh, their toppings generous and the fact that they were one of the first restaurants to grill their sandwiches, they were unique. From age 12-18, my birthday dinner desires were all fulfilled at Schlotzskys. Fast-forward 2 decades... The original sandwiches are still available. The location in Tempe, unfortunately, is closed for a remodel. Discovering this, I returned home to look up another location. The tossup between 44th and Thomas and Warner and Alma School...! As I'm at Baseline and Mill, the biggest consideration was traffic. At 7 PM on a Tuesday, I figured the run east would be easier. I drove...and got to the store 7:20 PM. On walking in, while the exterior of the location is kind of dark, the interior certainly works. Recessed lighting, the feeling of faux rustic in appetite-stimulating colors...tables full of folks eating many discounted sandwiches...it felt like a good location for serious sandwich aficionados. When I got to the register, the guy before me had been courteously rejected when he asked to order 10 of the discount sandwiches to go. In placing my order with the manager/owner? I requested 3 small originals (the offering advertised). My preference for the jalapeno cheddar bread was greeted with an expression of relief. Other customization: no lettuce, extra onion, extra olive and add jalapeno on each. 10 minutes later, my sandwiches are bagged and ready. Driving home, the aroma of toasted bread and warm meat, along with savories tempted me to dig into the bag. I resisted, as this was dinner for me and mine. Arriving at home, I brought the conquest in. Unwrapping the first, I observed no jalapeno or cheese on the bread. On taking a bite, there was no indication of significant onion, olive or jalapeno. Lowering the sandwich and taking the top off was a disappointment. 1 slice of tomato, a scattering of onion and olives, and no jalapeno. The receipt showed the order correctly, but the end result did not match. After the unfortunate discovery, I called the restaurant. As the person who answered had a very thick hispanic accent, I knew I was not talking to the manager/owner, who is working to lose her Brooklyn accent. I asked for the manager, and on she came. In advising the sandwiches are incorrect, she asked me to return the sandwiches...so she could make it right. I advised that this would be 40 minutes round-trip, and I would not be back in the neighborhood until next week. She suggested I freeze the incorrect product and bring it when I get into the neighborhood...she will make it right. I appreciate the effort to fix an order that's wrong...so I will return the remaining incorrect sandwiches. Here's to hoping I can upgrade this review from 2 stars...!",1
34397,"I wasn't feeling RnR at all! We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us. Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices. We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed. I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day. Breakfast is what I wanted. Oh well. We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer. The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired. They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard. Yuck. The corn dogs were only okay. The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor. The burger was enormous. Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor. I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size. The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!) Anyway, I was obviously not impressed. We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then.",1

33465,"By far the best hotel on the strip. The rooms are great. I stayed in a one bedroom suite with a view of the fountains. The view is definitely worth the extra money. It was amazing. We were able to see the fountains from our room, we didn't even have to go outside on the balcony. The room i stayed in came with a mini fridge, that was empty, so I was able to put my alcohol in there rather than having to put it in an ice bucket. Another plus about this hotel is the customer service. The staff is amazing and the dealers at the tables are awesome! I love gambling here because the dealers are super talkative and always help me out on my basic strategy at the black jack tables. You honestly don't even need to leave the hotel. The gambling here is great, they have the hottest club in Vegas right, and some of the best restaurants. This hotel is definitely worth the extra money.

So I did their free brewery tour on Sat/13 and then bought the $100 gift card which came with the bonus $40. Then I applied the $140 towards buying their $49 stainless steel growler (including a fill of beer, I opted for the award-winning El Jefe jalapeno beer) and $50 VIP tix to their 1 year anniversary party. 2) Sat/27 Dec - Used my VIP tix for their 1 year anniversary - Had a great time. 3) This is my favorite brewery in Vegas and the staff (Chris, Maria...) and Eddie (a co-owner) are great folks. Will be back many a times.",4
24535,"Since my initial visit during their first year opened, I've been back a handful of times and felt it was time I updated my review. Raku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests. Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary. We attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm. We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats! Sweet! But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend. The thing to look out for is the Specials Board. They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items. The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there. During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else. The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for. (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster. They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them! They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!) So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day! We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best! These days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items. One of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5). It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried. I don't know why it's so good but it just is. And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd! I just love it. Another item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10). There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose. The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste. Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture. You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam. It's a tasty nonetheless. The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy. The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game. And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once. I always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint. They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions. The four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce. Yum! Since they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at. First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! Service on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit. The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too. My only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests. One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food. I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him. It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods. When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working. Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food. Yuck. Nonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it. But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed! 4.5 stars.",4
39519,"Not sure what all the hype in prior reviews is about. This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've been in. The food is routine at best. The frying oil was old and made the Mongolian BBQ taste rancid. This place has been reincarnated several times, and each time it gets dirtier and worse. This is far from the best and closer to one of the worst.",0
3067,"Beer is ok. Food...meh. After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best. BJs is no exception to this rule. The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread. It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage. Tomatoes, yes. Cheese, yes. Sausage...not so much. There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage. As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts. Overall not a good effort. So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also.",1
19559,"Here is my gripe. The food is good. No complaints there. It's the employees. While standing at the register and ordering, there were three girls behind the counter that kept staring at my wife, whispering, and rolling their eyes. They were literally looking her up and down. I had sunglasses on so they could not see that I was watching them, and actually my wife didn't notice it because she was busy ordering for our kids. After we went and sat down, I continued to watch them, and from a distance I not only observed the girls gawking at various femaie customers, but two of the male employees were also gawking at various girls and nudging and elbowing each other and staring. I have noticed this going at a two other restaurants, Rubios just up the street, and Port O Subs at Desert Ridge. And it's not like I'm looking for this, I just have a habit of noticing details in my surroundings. I would like to know if I am the only person in the world that notices things like this, because this behavior seems to be very common and management knows nothing (or does nothing) about it.",0
42514,"Ugh! Wow... I think of myself as a very fair foodie analyst but my first experience at Al's Pizza was a dud... to be fair, I did order take out so I cannot speak of the service or ambiance. But, I can say that as I waited for my order I saw several kitchen employees walk into the front door of the restaurant and they looked like they slept in the same clothes as the day before... frankly, they looked unkempt and unwashed and my first thoughts flashed to what the kitchen might look like... there could be a correlation. I would have sent those guys right back home if I was the manager... OK.. to the food... another dud... I ordered the 16\"" SPICY CARIBBEAN CHICKEN and it was bland, lacked any discernible quantity of chicken, the crust was comparable to cardboard, and the over-salted flavor was bland with a hint of pepper and garlic... MYEH! I have to say that I had a stomach ache hours later and I desperately prayed that I didn't have food poisoning... I did not but if their food can bother my iron-clad stomach then something is not right... I also ordered the cheese sticks that looked and tasted like industrially-flash frozen erasers (yes, I was one of those weird 3 year-olds once that tasted everything)... while the breading was unique and good there lacked any real amount of cheese in the sticks... I took a bite and there was more air than cheese... I guess their intention was to have the gap filled with the AOK marinara? LOL... I think not... Anyway... with the huge amount of competitors around their store I think I'll eat pizza elsewhere...",0
2298,"First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy.

24448,"I go to Shag Me Salon to see Jacqueline - She's great! I recently moved to Vegas and hated the fact that I had to find a new stylist. I get my hair cut & colored regularly, so it was really important to find a new stylist that I click with. Sometimes you just don't click, right? Luckily, Jacqueline is awesome & I would recommend her to everyone I know! For a full cut & color every 6 weeks, the price is reasonable. What I really like about the salon is that they don't push the products on you. I've been to so many salons where I've felt pressured to purchase the expensive products they sell. Not here! If you need to get your hair did, make an appointment with Jacqueline! Tip - Zappos employees get a discount!",3
17480,"I'm going to bump up a star for them because since my initial visit (over 2 years ago) my opinion has shifted slightly. With the addition of other bars on this part of Fremont, The Griffin has become, for me, a good starting point when I'm trying to get cheaper (relative to the other bars) drinks that are made strong. Maybe the \""cool kids\"" have flocked to new bars because the scene in here isn't so cool-drab as it was before. I like the fire places and whenever the back room is open, the music is diverse. They've played 80's in the back before and if they played that every night I'd give them 4 stars.",2
48688,"A group of ladies going to Vegas for a fun weekend. We were excited that the hotel was located in the middle of the strip. It was very disappointing when we got inside and it was still being remodeled. Which is fine if they wouldn't have reassured us (twice) that it was finished. We asked for adjoining rooms and were put in two separate towers. Elevators had duct work hanging out. Electrical wires all over the place. Once we got to our floor the wall paper was ripped, carpet torn, stains on the walls, and the worst stench! When we get in the room the smell was horrible. Only two lights that did not do a good job of lighting the room. When we flushed the toilet, a sewer stench filled the whole room. The balcony door was forced locked with a nail jammed in the locking mechanism. Not a security in sight!!!! I woke up early and went to the casino. On the way up I was approached by two individuals by the elevator. The elevator was in a location isolated from the common areas. The woman made me very nervous. She continuously kept looking at my wallet. I decided to pretend to have forgotten something and left the area. They did not board the elevator and left the hotel. I am convinced that they were going to do some harm once I was alone with them in that elevator. I went looking for a security guard and NOT ONE IN SIGHT! I have been to many hotels in Vegas and NEVER have I felt worse! The staff was not understanding at all. They promised a meal credit and when we tried to redeem it, it had not been \""updated\"" in the system\"" (shocker!). STAY AWAY FROM THE QUAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
43447,"I stopped by here because I heard tell of Irish nachos made with waffle fries. I've had better. The serving size was pretty small. And it was just cheese, green onions, bacon, and sour cream. Who puts bacon on nachos? They were more like haphazard potato skins. The Irish nachos I crave from Callahan's have refried beans, jalapenos, salsa, etc. I also had a blue cheese and steak salad which was so so. On the plus side, the server/bartender had a great accent and adeptly managed the entire restaurant on his own. And they had Innis & Gunn Irish Whiskey Cask on tap, which was super yummy! Their beer list isn't all that impressive to me, but ask... they have some gems hidden back there. All in all, good for drinking but not a gastropub by any stretch of the imagination. It's just typical bar food.",2

It smells really good but has no taste whatsover. Even after adding soy sauce and pepper it's unedible. I'm so surprised because I love fried rice and who can mess that up. Now I have to find something else to eat for lunch.",1
36870,"My experience at BRGR started shaky but slowly improved. First, we were put on a half hour to forty-five minute wait for a party of two (note, they only accept walk-in reservations). The restaurant didn't seem to be at full capacity; however, we ventured to the neighborhood in order to try this burger spot, so we didn't want to overhaul our plans. #endrant Once we were seated, I ordered the BRGR fries and a alcoholic milkshake (the Cupajoe). The fries were thick cut and soft - not quite to my liking. They were also covered in shredded Parmesan cheese which didn't work for me. The shake was where the night started to improve. The alcohol the used was a bit poignant - not strong but overwhelming in taste. Otherwise, the shake was decent. I enjoyed the alcoholic shakes at Burgatory more. The night hit it off for me when we switched from a high table to one of the cozy couch areas. These areas are meant for about five people and are great for talking with a group while chowing down and watching the game on a multitude of screens (inclduing a large projector screen). The high point was the burger. I ordered the shrooms burger cooked at rare. The rare is more like medium rare at other places which was perfect for me. It was so juicy. It came with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and a drawing mustard aioli. It was so sweet and savory. Just a superb all-around burger. I would certainly return for it. In terms of the overall experience, I prefer Burgatory to BRGR, but I wouldn't discount BRGR for a good burger especially when you're in the area.",3
2218,"Not so much a liberal approach to reporting as a brainless attempt to convey \""news,\"" New Times has continued to disappoint and frustrate me on a weekly basis.

The former keeps me informed (and sometimes offers new ideas to keep that spark going ;) ) while the latter gives me something to plan on doing over the weekend. Honestly, it was N&D that turned me on to Cazwell. Some times the restaurant and movie reviews aren't painful. Otherwise, there is no worthwhile content in this paper. That, and I feel I've been duped by their fabricated stories a few too many times and you're wasting your time; you're not The Onion and are wasting our time if you think you are.

16150,"The MGM Garden arena has to be about 20 years old. My sister and I went to see Miley Cyrus on a Saturday night. I am gonna write this review in Pros and Cons list style. PROS: -Really not a bad seat in the house. -Amazing acoustics for live music. -Has a large capacity. -Drinks/Concessions are ridiculously over priced. -Clean facility. -Friendly staff. Cons: -There is no easy way to the arena. It is a trek. I usually wouldn't complain, but recovering from surgery, I can complain. So, keep that in mind. -The stadium seating is killer on the legs. I am 5'10\"", when the lady sat down in the seat in front of me, her seat back dug into my shins. I am ONLY 5'10\"" people. I had to sit side saddle to sit semi-comfortably. -The ushers are a little older (okay, a lot, it's a sign of the economic times) and did little/nothing to help a way too inebriated (barely, if legal age) fellow meandering up and down the stairs - As soon as the show was over (I'm the type to stay seated until the masses clear out), I was urged to get up and get out. I had to make a run to the ladies and I was met with SILVER CURTAIN and was denied entrance to restroom. I get that 11 PM may be past their bed time but they shouldn't close the restrooms as soon as the performance was over. I have seen many great shows here Bette Midler, Britney Spears, Madonna, NSync, Aerosmith, No Doubt, Elton John, and the list goes on... For that, the MGM will always hold awesome memories, but the staff in the joint dinged it a star and the arena could for sure use an update to 20.",2
29919,"I'm with Alice and Jonathan on this one, I HATE this club. To be fair though, it's because of personal experiences so I've given it the benefit of the doubt, star-wise. This club and Lulu are the main haunts for the yah's and socialites of the city. It sometimes screams pretentious, but sometimes it's actually pretty normal! The main student nights are Thursday and Friday, so avoid them if you don't want to be asked for a cigarette and what daddy does. I came here on a Saturday with my mum (HI MUM!) and my brothers after my brothers 21st dinner. There were about 15 of us, so we got priority entry and a table in a sectioned off area. Hey, we were pretty special. My mum and I went to the bathroom and when we went to go back to our table, they wouldn't let us in!! They said once we had left we couldn't get back. There was nothing we could say or do, so we ended up going home. Leading on from this, the bouncers here are amongst the worst I've ever come across. Give them a little bit of power and they think they can dictate your life. PAH! ahem. So, overall it's not that bad. It can be a bitty yah, but it does play quite good music and it can be a good night. The smoking area is tiny (they are just steps Opal!) and the queue can be a nightmare.

10696,"Our salesman was new and great. We were originally happy with this dealership. Our new car's payment was slightly higher based on the negative equity in our old vehicle. A few days after buying the new vehicle, we received the statement on the old loan. It turns out, $600 less was owed on it than we had estimated. We were informed that any extra money ($600) would come back to us after the loan was paid off. Today we get a statement from the finance company stating the loan was paid off. There was no mention of the extra $600. After phone calls and looking at the paperwork, we realized the paperwork that was printed out was NOT the same as what was signed in the office. I was a bit suspicious that you had to sign the electronic papers rather than a hard copy. It turns out, they DO change the information before printing. Our paperwork had no mention of the car payoff. No mention of a trade in, whatsoever. I'm not sure where that extra $600 went that they figured into our payments, but it didn't go to the old finance company and it isn't coming back to us.",0
33780,"BEWARE!! You do not want to see this doctor. He is ONLY in the health care industry in order to over bill insurance companies. I was referred to this practitioner and when I checked his credentials I didn't find any board actions. I called to make an appointment and let his office know that I was a cash patient with no insurance and was looking for a specific type of doctor. I was never told that he does not write refills, but rather forces his patients to come into his office every month, which for a cash patient is initially $220 and then $150 every subsequent month. He charges ridiculous fees too. He charges a $25 fee if you are more than SEVEN (7) minutes late to appointment and then they cancel the appointment and make you reschedule. This while I waited in his waiting room for almost 2 hours before I was taken back to a room and then waited another 30 minutes. They also charge a $50 fee to fill out paperwork that may be required by an insurance company, if it's more than 2 pages long!! Another Yelper wrote that she liked the tablet computers you use to do your paperwork on, but she perhaps didn't notice the additional fees they charge you to have digital paperwork/files. He refused to help me with the initial cost of the visit and told me he NEVER works with his patients if they cannot afford to see him. Apparently they would prefer to lose patients rather than help them out. Also when I called to make an initial appointment I was never told the doctor does not confer with other doctors, such as your prior doctor, and never writes refills. He also refuses to give patients additional medication if they run out over a weekend and can't get in to see him before they run out. Had I known about all this beforehand I would never have made an initial appointment. When I told that to the girl on the phone, she insisted that only two people make these types of appointments and they always tell the patients this. NOT!! Save yourself some serious hassles and stay away from this guy!! I've never seen a provider that refused to help out his patients monetarily if they are in a bind and really need help. I've never seen a provider that refused to speak with my old doctor in order to get additional information about me. And I've never seen a provider that refused to write refills and forced his patients to see him every month instead. Seriously, who does this? Oh yeah, Dr. Allen does!! Not to mention that not more than two (2) weeks after seeing this doctor I got very sick and found out I had gallstones and needed to have my gallbladder removed, but for some reason Dr. Allen MISSED this diagnosis.

9722,"So we picked the Rio to try because the pictures of the pool looked awesome. When we got there I was pretty happy with the room and casino, we went out to the pool and they have 4 total, 1 adult only that is closed except on the weekends. We bought a football and everyone had an ok time. When the adult pool finally opened we were all excited, dj, good music, we were throwing the football around and probably 15 people we didn't know all joined in. That's when the problems began, there was a lady who was probably in her 60s got mad, the football didn't go near her, but she wanted to lay on her noodle in the middle of the pool and us having fun bothered her, so the lifeguard was cool and Told us just to try and keep it on half of the pool and her to stay on the other side. She got mad they didn't make us stop and got out. Well more and more people joined in, about 20 people having fun just throwing a ball around, someone new threw the ball across the other side of the pool cause he didn't know we weren't supposed to, so the lady gets back in the pool and lays directly in the middle of our side where we are throwing the ball. Someone throws it and it lands next to her, she gets pissed and starts yelling, the manager comes over and tells us, this is our last warning, my.friend goes to get the ball and the lady grabs his arm and starts screaming at him!!! So he gets the ball and starts to get out, the manager comes back over and tells him they are Gunna kick is out, huh????? Im sorry I don't think.We are the ones who grabbed anyone. We watched about 15 people leave the pool after that, dead, nothing fun going on. I wouldn't ever stay here again. As a business why would you not want people having fun, drinking, not causing any issues, isn't that exactly what you.should want? Instead u allow someone to grab another person and threaten to kick the person who got grabbed out? Go to flamingo, great pool and they like their guests to have fun",0

First off gone are the Horseradish / cranberry flavored vodka shots. When I went Eliseevsky no longer had a license to server alcohol. Secondly the menu has been reduced by a fair amount. The menu on the website (which has not as of this posting been updated) speaks of caviar, veal, beef in sweet & sour sauce, Shashlik\"" (kebab) and many more all of which no longer exists. I had the chicken Kiev (butter filled); also sampled the borscht and my friend said the pork soup was good. The food was still good but none of it knocked me off my feet. The atmosphere seems to have remained largely unchanged. Still looks like a log cabin, modern Russian music plays in the background. Our server also performed a selection of Russian titles (not sure if he was lip syncing or not). The service was a bit slow even with the restaurant being mostly empty. But I attribute that to a loss of the art of dining on my part. I will probably go back and try another dish or two but buyer beware the price remains at about 12 -16 a dish.

6700,"I had heard good things about Bon Appetit being a new-ish local-foods cafe in Madison, and so had been excited to try it. But we left the restaurant very disappointed. For one thing, there was almost nothing that could have possibly been local in our meals, as far as I could tell. The majority of the dishes on the small menu featured non-seasonal fruits and vegetables, like avocado and strawberry and tomato. On top of that, the non-local foods we did have were prepared in fairly bland ways (and such small portions!*), especially given the relatively steep prices (entrees at $19). The food was fine, but given these caveats, really not worth it. And although the service was passable, the fact that the waitress and chef sat and talked very loudly, in the most boring ways possible, about movie trivia through our whole meal (\""have you seen that one movie with that British gal? You know the one who was married to Nathan Lane? Oh you mean the one who won that Emmy?\"")**, made the whole setting very uncomfortable.

It is a big room, so the buffet is spread out. (But food is grouped .... fruit here, cereals there, pancakes/waffles, etc.) So my husband totally missed the fruit section, where they have the smoothies. And, he missed the hostess's instructions that a server would be around to bring drinks. So when he saw the fridge full of alcohol and water bottles he thought that was it and innocently tried to grab a bottle of water. He was immediately scolded and embarrassed by a manager who came shooting across the room to announce there would be a charge for the water. Use more tact here, he's not a criminal. As far as buffets go, this is your average run of the mill one. Nothing to warn you about, nor really praise. Oh... The music level is a little loud. But we experienced that a lot in Vegas. Weird.",2
49706,"We were thrilled to finally get a Cafe Rio in our area. However, after several visits we are ready to say goodbye to our new location and travel back to the Stephanie or Eastern locations. The service here is horrible, the restaurant is freezing cold and the food is less than mediocre. The servers are rude and when I ask for extra pico, I am treated like I am asking for something impossible! It is time for management to step-up and take control and make some much needed changes!!!",0
7338,"Great location to soak up some drink before you go home to pass out. The staff can be nice or rude depending on you. (I prefer rude) The food is good, nothing pretentious or assuming. You get what they give you and you eat it. I don't think I would bring Mom for Sunday Breakfast but for a quick bite, it hits the spot. Better then Denny's unless you want your Superbird or French Toast. The waitress was even nice enough to call a cab for us.",3
21259,Oh my gosh! Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome. Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked.,4
44685,Total fun. Funner than a competitor that rhymes with sakasan. The line can be daunting. Luckily I skipped all that with staff glist. I paid. My girl didn't. I didn't care I was prepared for that. i felt like: that ramp up on space mountain right before you drop. with all the lights and effects. it was pretty cool. As soon as you walk in you feel the energy. It's people PARTYING!! not just standing around waiting for the hot DJ to perform. People are dancing and drinking and having a blast. I met alot of tourists from other states. It was cool. The LED monitors were incredible. It really added to the experience. The DJ was on point. I didn't catch his name. I really like the cirque de soleil flavor. Girls swinging from the ceiling. Ribbon dancing. Acrobatics. it was awesome. The one thing that keeps me from giving them a flawless score is the crowd. It's a good crowd for the most part but one particular culture dominates the ethnic spectrum. (not white). And it made it hard to mingle and meet people. I like a diverse crowd with equal ratios. Preferable more girls than guys. I would definitely return. I had a lot of fun here.,3
40625,"Not too bad! Been to this location several times, still have not loved it yet. The antipasta platter was ok. The mozzarella was good; the brushette had too much pesto; and calamari was not crispy enough. The chicken marsala was ok too. I tasted more of the grill of the chicken than the marsala sauce. The mash potatoes were good. I should have stuck to my usual pasta carrabba. The service is always excellent!",2
37785,"My friends and I arrived at the Wicked Spoon half an hour before they were closing the buffet. But it was all good! We were hungry anyways. At least I thought I was. Unfortunately, I didn't have the appetite (aka a bit hungover) to eat and gorge on buffet food. I really tried! I didn't want to eat too much, too fast and then have to head to the ladies room to puke it. :( I envied my friends who were able to eat. I tried the shortribs, yum. I was able to stomach that. I tried some of this pasta with lamb stuff, just nibbled a little bit. Sadly, that was all I remember eating. I think I also had noodles. After nibbling what I could, I headed for the the dessert station. My stomach was ok with the sweets. My favorite were these little chocolate mousse cups filled with blueberries - I had at least two. Lesson learned, never go to a buffet hungover (at least for me anyways). I would like to come back here (some day) to try out the brunch! I will be sure to visit sober and super-hungry!!",2
46152,"Got to say this place is the best. I am from Buffalo and eating here makes me feel like home. If you are in the mood for pizza buffalo style this is your place. Chicken wings best in the area better than Anchor Bar. The subs are amazing chicken Philly, steak bomber and cheeseburger sub you cannot go wrong w Costanzo roll wow. In the mood for Italian food try the chicken Parm wow. There isn't 1 bad thing on the menu. Everything is made from scratch and fresh. This place is the best hope it grows into more in the Charlotte. Best part beside the food is the staff owners Jimmy and Steve make you feel like you are eating at home. If you like good good trust me eat here.",4
33447,"According to one of our cab drivers when we were in Vegas, The Cosmopolitan is one of the new hotels on the strip and I must say, it's really an impressive building inside and out. I love the Chandeliers. They sparkles and they are such major BLINGS. I can just stand there and just admiring those pretty bling bling bling. They have different shops than other hotels on the strip which is a big plus. It's kinda tiring to see the same shop over and over again on Vegas strip, The Cosmopolitan is definitely a breathe of fresh air.",3
34240,"A visit to Wild East for lunch with a girlfriend today was a solid 3 (the good 3, not the meh 3). Their lunch specials are Monday - Saturday 11:00 - 4:00. Along with lunch prices are lunch portions (sigh). My girlfriend is a lover of sushi, and with 3 wee ones she doesn't get her choice for meals very often, so she suggested Wild East for lunch. I had never been, but it was on my radar. I usually pass by during rush hour traffic where it is almost impossible to get in or out of this cute little place, depending on which way you are going. I arrived around 12:45 and it looks like I just missed the lunch rush, they were busy busing just about every table in the place, so their lunch crowd must be a big one. Girlfriend ordered a plate of 3 kinds of sushi. 6 small pieces each (small compared to the ginormous rolls they serve at Cowfish, I don't eat sushi, so I have no other comparison). I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special with white rice. Lunch specials come with your choice of salad or soup (wonton, hot and sour, miso). I had been wanting to try miso, so I went with that. I can say that I have tried it now, not a fan. The girlfriend also ordered the miso and ate all of it, so I am going to say that my dislike was personal taste preference and not the quality of the soup. Onto the Mongolian Beef ($7). Well flavored. I am accustomed to the PF Changs version, served with green onions, which I don't eat. Wild East is served with regular onions, which I prefer and they were cooked well. There was a large ice cream scoop of white rice on one corner of the plate and small/medium portion of the Mongolian Beef served on a few of the white crunchy noodles (I don't know what they are called...). It was mostly Mongolian and not much Beef. The few pieces of beef were very well flavored and tender, I just wish there had been more, there may have been 5 small, thin pieces of beef in the dish. While disappointed with the portion, my lunch was very good. The service was friendly and attentive with the drink refills. The restaurant appeared clean and the host was quite nice. I would return if my girlfriend needs another sushi fix.",2
18775,"So.... our teenage daughter ran out of toilet paper. No problem, right? I'll just use paper towels... for 2 days. Yeah, it was a mess and Roto Rooter fixed it. For only $400.00. so then... they come back the next day to snake a camera thru the pipes. I think maybe they were looking for problems because well, they found them. Price quote.... between five to eight thousand dollars to repair some pipes. Errrrrrrrrrrr..... I don't think so. Did they do a good job with the problem at hand? Yep. Were they expensive? Yeah.... I guess Do I think they're now looking for an extra paycheck? What do you think?",2
14764,"Eureka, I've got it!!! \""Ah (what a) Sin\"" to eat here! ;) Ok, ok...I'm being a bit harsh. It wasn't ALL that bad, but it was not by any means ALL that great either. It was our last sushi stop on our little tour of Vegas sushi houses, and I'm glad it was! I think if I would have eaten there before; it would have turned me off to trying any others. I mean, I guess you get what you pay for...we were doing our little touristy walking the strip, taking pictures thing, and stumbled upon a beautiful glossy sign that read \""All you can eat sushi for $20\"" SCORE!!! Being that we were in Vegas, we took a gamble (see what I did there, Vegas - gambling?) ok moving on....the restaurant is pretty, the outdoor dining faces the fountains @ the Bellagio...which is always an amazing show to watch so it wasn't all that bad. The food however, left us a bit disappointed. We didn't say anything though, because our waiter was so nice and kept asking if we would like anymore. He looked quite shocked that we didn't order any rolls other then our allotted 3 at a time deal...especially since we left half of the food on our plates. The ma\u00eetre d' was also VERY helpful with telling us about some cool comedy shows to check out...he even went as far as to phone-a-friend to see if he could score us some tickets or discounts. So overall, the food will be forgotten...but the service will forever be embedded in my memory. (Or until the Alzheimer kicks in) C+",1
39783,"I love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale so I was excited when I found one in Chandler. However, I was more than disappointed. This place has no business calling itself Grimaldi's and should be ashamed! I love love love Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, but this location does not even compare. If you are going to pay this much for pizza it better damn well be good!! Makes me very sad and I will NEVER go to this location again. No flavor.",0
18909,"Service INSIDE can be slow sometimes, since they seem to worship the drive-thru customers and get all of their orders first, or at least with significant priority. Staff is polite. It's a real PITA to have to get refills from them though, instead of having the soda dispensers out for self-serve. Are they really saving much money by doing this? When there are lines of people to order, it's a bit much to butt in line to ask for a refill... or maybe that's the point.",1
34136,"Another restaurant with loads of fake \""memorabilia\"" on the walls. When I arrived, they walked me past a bunch of open tables to the table farthest in the back, right next to the constantly swinging kitchen door, and facing the table that was being used by the staff to fold napkins. If it were not for the fact that the busboy folding napkins had a great butt, I would have complained. Later, when they found out that I am conducting one of the big shows in town, they offered to move me to a better table. I politely declined, (Too Late) but thought; \""Ya mean if you'd thought that I wasn't your average customer, you would have given me a reasonable table?\"" Not good. They advertise as \""Not your standard gringo Mexican food place\"". But that's exactly what I found. The food was all very average. The tomatillo salsa that was served on my \""Enchiladas Suizas\"" was the same that was served with the chips when I arrived. The chicken inside did not seem spiced or marinaded in any way. The tortillas were dull. The margarita was good (made with fresh lime juice), but it was not \""the original\"" margarita, as advertised. According to Hussong's history, the original was made with Damiana liqueur, which adds a slightly bitter, herbal flavor. Here, they substitute Cointreau, which is citrusy and very sweet - again, appealing to the average Gringo. I've mentioned this before, but I'll bring it up again: Las Vegas is jam-packed with awesome Mexican restaurants - and most of them are dirt cheap. If you're gonna charge $16 for an enchilada, you'd better back it up with outstanding food; interesting drinks, and impeccable service. I did not find any of those here.",1
13846,"After many red bull vodkas and whatever shots my friends were feeding me, my recollections of this place were limited to say the least. At least, I remember up to the point where someone got freaky on me...whups, I didn't just say that. Seriously though, great space, huge inside, with lots of energy, and a balcony for fresh air after shakin your booty all night long. As mentioned, don't wait in line, flirt with the hotties, and have a great time! What happens at Tao, stays at Tao!",4
34366,"I have to give this establishment a major FAIL tonight. Didn't wanna do it, but their completely amateurish, mindless faux pas tonight behind the bar forced me to do it. Okay, so...what bartender would toss out an almost-full champagne flute of high-end sparkling sake - wait for it - with a receipt covering the top of it (universal barspeak for \""do not touch\""!)??? Apparently \""Doug\"" would. So, I return from a quick trip to the restroom and find my receipts, water glass and champagne flute mostly full of my Zipang disposed of by the man who was just seconds earlier being so kind and accommodating. Well, something's very wrong with this picture, folks. And, did they apologize, when I expressed my dismay, saying \""That's why I put the receipt on top of the glass...it was an almost-full flute...\""? No. Just a \""get him another one\"" directive from the manager to good ol' Dougie...nothing from the barkeep in question like \""Oh, sorry, man. Thought you'd split and left most your drink, covered by your receipt\"" (Apparently a quite common occurrence in \""Doug World\"")...Nah, just an uncomfortable vibe due to their (his) glaringly poor bartending decision. I sipped my replacement drink and was treated as if I should have cleared out already - or was it the painful embarrassment of a ridiculous bartending mistake hovering over us at that point? I should think the latter. Both are uncomfortable and should be avoided at all costs. Uh, bottom line (and covered in Bartending Basics 101), Stingray staff: Any object covering a mostly-full drink is probably an indicator from the patron that they are coming back, and wish to consume the rest of said drink.",0
20496,This place isn't all that. Maybe its cause I went in there to early in the day. Didn't really look like a great place to party or waste a lot of time in. Although it did have a nice Irish look. But I still won't go back.,1
44263,"If you want high quality suits and good customer service, DO NOT go to this store!! My family scheduled a Scottsdale trip at the end of the school year for our kids. In our rush to get out of Seattle, I only packed half my swimsuit. The closest swimsuit place to our hotel was Everything But Water in the very upscale Kierland Commons. My first impression was friendly, helpful and attentive service. I found a suit that I loved with the necessary underwire in the top. It was close to $200 but I figured a quality suit is worth the price. I even bought a cute cover up that the sales girl suggested. Fast forward two days. After day two of swimming, I took off the suit and realized that one of the underwires had ripped through the fabric and had almost come completely out of the suit. I immediately took the suit back to the store. I thought for sure they would allow me to return the suit because it was clearly defective. No way!! They only offered to exchange the suit even though you could see that the new top would have the exact same issue. I said I did not want such a poor quality suit and I wanted my money back. Still no refund. To make matters worse, my original sales girl kept smirking at the other sales girls as if I was trying to pull a fast one. I left with the new top because I had no other choice. I felt completely robbed!! I come from the land of Costco and Nordstrom where customer service is tops. This store should take a lesson. UPDATE After posting this review here and on the company Facebook page, I was contacted by Michele at Everything But Water corporate. She was amazing!! She contacted me personally, apologized for the inconvenience, assured me that I would be given a refund and let me know that my experience did not reflect company policy. This was all done within a week of me arriving back home. Do I still think that the service I received at Kierland Commons in Scottsdale (by one particular associate) was awful? Yes, hence the 1 star rating. However, the company took great care of me after the fact, (Michele in particular) so I will be checking out the Bellevue, WA store to see if I have better luck in finding my perfect suit. If Michele reflects the overall quality of employees at Everything but Water, I give them 5 stars!!",0
3589,"I cannot say enough great things about Copyfast! When it comes to award winning service and product production - they are at the top of my list. It is nice to know that family-oriented, specialized copy centers still exist! I had the opportunity to meet the owners one day, although at that time - I did not know that they owned Copy Fast. After a brief chat with them - I can see why their copy center is the best in town. I knew I loved this place before, but now after meeting them and hearing about the passion they have for their store, their customers and their employees - I am even more thrilled that I have this place to go to for all my copy needs!",4
34887,"Worst customer service experience I can remember. We sat down at a blackjack table and were completely ignored by the dealer, Lisa. We watched her deal four or five hands to the gentleman that was already sitting at the table when we got there without her even looking at us or saying a word. When we repeatedly asked if we could get chips for the money which we had on the table she didn't even acknowledge us. It was quite surreal. I asked a manager on the floor what was going on and he said that he didn't know and that there was nothing he could do!? I then spoke to his boss, Albert. All Albert was able to tell me was that he was sorry and that he would buy me a drink. I told him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to know why I was treated so rudely. He made no effort to talk to the dealer or check the tapes and did not take down my contact information to resolve the issue the following day. I felt his tone was condescending and dismissive. I don't recall ever being treated so rudely by an employee or being disregarded so bluntly by management in my life. I will not be going back to the Talking Stick Resort & Casino ever again.",0
47132,"This chocolate shop is quite simply the best, and a must visit not only for yourself (yes they give free samples), but also any special person in your life that you can't figure out what to get, but your present needs to say that they are simply worth and deserving of the best! For those not in the know, Belgium chocolate is the best bar none. Yes, that right better that Swiss, German and even my favorite English, but that's only because I'm British and grew up on the stuff. That said, any serious European will tell you that Belgium chocolate is the best and what you buy for that special person in your life whether it's your spouse, mother, grandmother and/or any man or woman that you need to impress. Heads up, they currently offer a 5 percent discount off your next purchase with your receipt. Also you can have dinner at 5th and Wine around the corner as their chocolate is on the dessert menu. I recommend eating fast, because you are going to want to get more chocolate before you head home.",4
6030,"I dig Hanlon's. I love that pretty much all of their dishes come with a side and the price is right. Everything on their menu sounds delish and it takes a little while for me to decide. For any hoagie, you can make it a wrap at no extra charge. I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap & its fabb !! I've also had the eye opener breakfast which is the works (eggs, meat, potatoes & toast) for $4.99. I've never had a salad from here, but they are huuuuge! & only around $9 which is the standard salad price downtown, but I've witnessed Hanlon's using 3/4 a head of lettuce in one salad, awesome!!",2
15359,"I had alway's heard about this place on the Food Network but for some reason I never knew there was one in Las Vegas. I only found it because my fiancee and I were going to watch Beatles Love at the Mirage and that's when I saw it. We were seated right away and after a lengthy look at the menu my fiancee decided on the chicken soup with noodles and I finally decided on getting the Woody Allen. The waiter warned me that it was a very big sandwich and just wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into. The soup was brought out and in the bowl was some noodles and the chicken soup in a little pitcher. They pour the soup onto the noodles in front of you. She loved the soup but I thought it was kind of bland. The sandwich finally arrived and OMG this thing is freaking huge. If you love corned beef and pastrami you will love this sandwich. One thing's for sure, they give you plenty of meat. Spread on some of their homemade mustard and take an occasional bite of their homemade pickles and everything just seems to meld with each other. I only ate half the sandwich and I took the rest home. The waiter was nice enough to give me a little container to take some of the homemade mustard home so I packed the meat, mustard and a few pickles and used my own bread at home to make another sandwich and it was just as good. Definitely have to go back there the next time I'm in Vegas again. Their desserts looked really good too.",3
18050,"We should have stuck with our \""no celebrity chef\"" policy, but we went and tried it anyway. I would NOT recommend this place. The food was bland. Major over-salting on one dish and no seasoning on another. Very small portions. The service was so formal it wasn't even a fun experience. I especially hated the manager pacing up and down the isle with his hands clasped behind his back. I felt like we were being watched. Historically I've loved Batali's restaurants, but this one is trying way to hard to be something. It needs to add a whole lot of friendliness to the place and o some serious evaluation of the food. I have no problem paying a couple hundred dollars for an amazing meal, but after this one I left hungry and wondering what I just ate and why it didn't taste all that good.",0

8103,"Let me start by saying that if excellent customer service is what you are looking for, this is not the place for you. Are the waitresses nice?....Sometimes. Are they efficient?.....Not usually. Do they get the orders right?.....most of the time. Do I love this place anyway???.....ABSOLUTELY! Here's why - Value of Happy Hour / Reverse Happy Hour / Weekend specials - 5 stars! There are not many places you can get a slice of pizza, a basket of wings (Golden Medium, yummm) AND a 32 oz frosty beer for about $10 bucks. They have daily specials, happy hour specials, weekend specials, and late night specials. If wings are not your thing, try the Monaco Focaccia - it is to die for! Ambiance - Ehhhh - 3 stars. This is just your typical sports bar. No special ambiance to note. However - bring your shooting skills, and give the arcade game Big Buck Hunter a try for some laughs, OR coerce your friends into playing some pool. I will concur with previous guests comments that the management at this establishment leaves something to be desired. I have had several experiences where management failed to provide a service or take care of a customer, and was less than apologetic about their unwillingness to help. All in all, I love Zipps - mostly for its convenience and it's cheap prices. I'd still recommend it though! :)",2
7239,My deadbeat boyfriend used to be in charge of the hardware department but since I kicked him to the curb I've had to venture out into this realm. So happy I found this place on Yelp. Can't say enough about the great customer service. So glad they had knowledgeable people to help this dingbat out and find just what I needed. The only downside (and hence the four stars) was the pricing seemed a little high. Not that I'm the best judge mind you. I think I could have saved at Home Depot but then again I wouldn't have got the same level of help so it's a trade off is all I'm saying.,3
27230,"I gotta say, one word, underwhelmed. I read the reviews, love Vietnames cuisine, have been trying a lot of it around Vegas and was craving soup. We got some spring roll things, which were the only four star item on the menu. Everything else was sorta meh. Good, well prepared, good service, with mediocre ingredients. Not too memorable. I might go back one more time if I look at the recent reviews and see some 5 stars comments. Otherwise it is all about David Wong's Pan Asian, Beijing Noodle Cafe, and Monta Ramen house which, in my opinion are in a league of their own (especially Pan Asian and Beijing Noodle Cafe).",2
35673,"Was really pleased with the little hotel. Great location directly across from Hard Rock, rooms were nice, staff was fantastic. Pool was nice.

Really liked that they welcomed our dog. Food and waitstaff was great.",3

I had the miso ramen with chicken, and I loved it. It was a gigantic bowl of flavorful broth, tender noodles, cabbage and chicken. It also came with two pieces of inari sushi. It was my first time having inari, and I liked it. An awesome, incredibly filling dinner for about 9 dollars. I may go back tonight.",4
8062,"This place is gooood. The food seems fresher than most indian food places, and it definitely doesn't taste like it's been sitting out all day. That might actually be a complaint. I'm so used to eating vegetable pakoras that have been sitting in a vat under a heat lamp that these were too fresh for me to like. You know? It's like being raised on Taco Bell and being so used to that as your definition of Mexican food that when you actually go to a Mexican food joint with fresh ingredients you're like, \""WTF is this?\"" Oh yeah, and it's definitely more expensive than other places in the valley.",4

5569,"To my mind, besides serving very good hamburgers, Wendy's Chili is so excellent and satisfyingly delicious that it is award worthy. Allowed to simmer for hours, this mixture of nicely seasoned Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, pieces of tomato, onion, celery, and lean beef drenched in a great kicky sauce is hard to beat. So much so that I almost never leave a Wendy's without ordering Chili along with a burger and fries. My square and rather flat quarter-pound burger topped with a single slice of American Cheese, and a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, pickles, and ketchup on a soft bun was quite tasty. But, alas, the skin-on fries were sort of dead tasting, with no hint of salt. 3-1/2 stars overall on my single visit here!",2
35932,"This playpark is the cooler older sibling of the Bruntsfield Links. It's bigger and brighter and a lot more shwing. Which is an adjective adapted from Wayne's World. It's the more fashionable older sibling, to boot. During the day it's inhabited by mothers and fathers, and, of course, children who're doing their children-thing, i.e. screaming and running and having fun. At night, though, beware, there're other inhabitants. Well, don't beware too much, but it's just full of children but ten years older than the ones who play there during the daytime. At least during the summer, when it's warm enough and daylight lasts pretty much 22 hours. This playpark's located at the edge of the Meadows that's closest to Arthur's seat. Right on the corner of Melville Drive and Buccleuch Street. This playpark's possibly the most colourful playpark in the city. Sadly, the only reason I've ever been here is to exercise, but I'm certain that if I lived here 10 years ago, this would be the place I'd hang.",4
11851,"Their most recent exposure on Top Chef: Masters had an out-of-town friend wanting to check this place out. After our first visit many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back. After making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy. Okay. We were a party of six - four adults and two kids. * Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) - Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce. This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies. * Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version. When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed. The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise. * The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry. (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.) When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it. (It also cost $20.95.) I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes. We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially. Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price. * We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper. Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35. Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it. When the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was. We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it. However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children. As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish. We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us. We ultimately decided we were done with the meal. I did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point. Overall, it was a disappointing visit. Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes? We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.",1
20859,"I usually dine at the Thomas Rd. location, where everything is great. This time, I decided to give this one a try, expecting a similar experience, but here's some of what I found up here: * It's quite similar inside to the Thomas Road location, but the dining area isn't furnished as well. * Went for soup first, as usual, but there were no soup spoons out, or available. (Have I eaten at 100 other buffets here in the Valley without ever having run into this?) An employee told me they let themselves run completely out of them to save money. (I thought to myself, \""They could save even MORE money by closing this location... and maybe they should!) * Went for a chicken wing, which is what I eat! The only way you could get one here, was firmly attached to more of the chicken! The whole thing was heavily breaded & cooked with the skin on, so there was no hope of pulling it apart at the serving tray. It was either take it the way you don't want it, or don't have it at all. Please someone, teach the preps here how to cut up a chicken!! (Was I 8, or 9, when I learned how to do it?) That's enough of an example of how the whole visit went here. You get the idea. Overall, the food was about the same as Thomas (good), but the serving area setup here is also not as attractive or convenient as the one on Thomas, so for me the place plummeted all the way down to 3-Stars from the 5 I had expected it to earn. On the way home, I sang \""Could've Been\"" by Tiffany.",2
6759,"I do not recommend this place for lunch. Service - Average Employees are friendly and competent, doing their jobs in a way that is expected. Food - A waste of money. I wish I could get a refund. The bread was hard, chewy, and tasted woody...like it would have been a tender crusty bread four days ago that was then left uncovered in the sun... (They keep their bread loaves uncovered, on a shelf, by giant windows where the sunlight beats down unhindered...I guess that should have been a warning sign.) The dill spread could easily have come in a budget tub from a grocer. The red onion slice was okay, though it's really hard to screw up raw onion. Sadly, you don't gain points for slicing an onion. The paper thin slices of cucumber were pointless, their flavor overwhelmed by the salmon & spread, and cut too thin to be crunchy. The small pieces of salmon were okay, though nothing exceptional. You can get similar fare from your local butcher. The side salad... ... ... wtf did they put on these greens? It tasted like bitter vinegary dish water. Portion size - Small It's acceptable as a very light lunch. Over all, the salad sucked, the bread blew and the rest left me unimpressed. If I'm paying $8.50 for a small open-faced (and therefore basically only a half) sandwich, it needs to be organic, local and mind blowing amazing. Atmosphere - Corporate / Faux - Indie Random second hand tables, though most had their own set of matching chairs. Sunlight from the large windows lights the place up, but be aware of where you sit to avoid excessive sun glare. Just a side note. Their website claims their chef \""draws inspiration from local, sustainable, and seasonal ingredients.\"" This is not the same as actually *using* local, sustainable and seasonal ingredients. I dislike it when restaurants use B.S. marketing manipulation. Only their bread and beverages include local ingredients, and not even 100% like they imply.",0

She is simply fantastic! This is not your spa or chain store massage, this is deep tissue as intense as you desire. She has several different styles but I prefer a strait sports massage.",4
20016,"Whenever I visit Vegas, I end up buying something at Fashion Show Mall. They have a great Macy's, Nordstrom's (if you are near they have free wifi), and lots of stores to meet lots of needs depending on what you are looking for. This visit I went to Skechers to check out if there were any sales on a specific pair of shoes I wanted but no such luck. I rested at the tables outside the food court as most were vacant. The seating in the food court is big and lots of variety including Chinese, burgers, hot dogs, fries, and wraps, and restaurants too . There isn't too much seating to take a break unless you go near the Nordstrom's and the hall that leads towards the strip. But at least it's comfortable and clean. There's also a taxi stop by Nordstrom's door and a valet that was helpful.",3

After synching up with her via pinterest and finding out that we have very similar tastes in photography, I reached out to her to line up a photoshoot! From the very beginning of our conversations, she was welcoming of ideas, very quick to respond to emails as well as being polite and funny. She came up with a great concept, and spent a ton of time getting the dresses, furniture and logistics squared away. During the shoot, she was overly prepared and had just about every little thing I would randomly ask for. Love that. Elizabeth is extremely detail orientated; not only in her email correspondence but also during the photoshoot and post-production. She's a perfectionist and a professional with an amazing eye for great photography and I'm extremely grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with her!! Definitely looking forward to seeing what we come up with next...",4

The place is a bit older and the tubs and equipment show wear. The water is plenty warm and the pressure can go up to super high. The available shampoo and conditioner are hypoallergenic. I decided to use my own shampoo since I prefer the smell. Brushes are also provided, but again, I used my own. The dryer has a super high blower motor, which removes the water, but doesn't use heat.. I had the staff trim the nails on my dog, they did a quick, gentle job. The dogs do roam freely in the sectioned off day care room. There is a frequent customer punch card, if you buy five washes, the sixth is free.",3
34843,"Oh man.. I don't know where to start with this place. I guess I just really fail to understand what all the hype is about. For starters, I'm not a fan of waiting in line to get into a restaurant UNLESS there's something absolutely fantastic about it. Kazu failed to meet that expectation. To be simple and to the point: 1. Too too too too crowded for my liking. I am not interested in grazing elbows with neighbors at a different table 2. The food is really nothing special 3. I guess a pro to all the chaos is that it's cheap (although we managed to spend over $100 for 3 people......but in theory it's *supposed* to be cheap) 4. The waiters are not in a happy mood (because it's so disgustingly packed all the time) I'll stop there. I feel like my bad review is useless amongst all the other great ones - maybe I'm just missing the point of this place!! Go try it yourselves - everyone I know loves it except for fiance and moi.....so clearly we're the misfits here haha",0

Our favorite of all of them? Mineos! It's like loading a shotgun full of delicious cheeses and pulling the trigger. Their pizza is all around good, but it's primarily a righteous cheese delivery system, and a cheese lovers delight!",3
41899,"If you want a good breakfast in Phoenix don't go to the Oink Cafe. Go to the Butterfield Restaurant on 7388 E. Shea Blvd in Scottsdale, AZ about seven minutes away. Had breakfast at the Oink Cafe got lousy service, greasy link sausages and hash browns, and mmisoma made with cheap Cupcake champagne. I had ordered patties sausages and got links. My wife ordered mmisoma so I asked for one too. Lucky the server forgot mines. My wife had barely drunk hers and offered me to taste it. The mmisoma was bitter due to the champagne. The server brought us our bill, first time returning after bringing our breakfast. I told her about the sausage, hash browns, mmisoma, etc. She spoke with her manager and took 10% off the bill. That was a joke! It was coded military/senior. I'll over 60 and look every bit. I was already entitled to a 10% discount. Just go to Butterfield Restaurant for a superb breakfast and fantastic service.",0
35290,"Walking around Caesars Palace to cool off and grab a snack. This place was there and their menu seemed appetizing. Decided to order from the takeout window instead of sitting down to eat. This place is right next to the sportsbook so if you're there, you can grab a snack and watch/bet on sports as well. Got the loaded waffle nachos. Crispy waffle fries topped with some bacon, nacho cheese and sour cream. Garnished with some parsley. Yes, there are better places to eat. But sometimes you just want something quick while walking around. Got our food pretty fast as well.",2

The hotel itself is \""boutique\"" as the website says, yet it has paper thin walls and we could hear the drunk people come home at 2am the night before our 8am race. In addition, this hotel was listed on the race website as a good place to stay, YET when we returned back from the race (which ends in Tempe and requires a 45 min train ride back), our hotel room door was locked with our stuff inside. We were then charged an additional \""1/2 day\"" fee in order to get our stuff out and shower rather than having a late check out. There is a Hyatt and a Westin near by ...stay there!!!!",1
42057,"Would never eat in this restaurant again. Lousy food and the service was worse. Took a friend there who came in from Florida. Our friend ordered a cup of soup before dinner and it came out in only what I can describe as something not much bigger than a thimble. Then the waitress tells us that this is their sampler so our friend ordered a bowl of soup. It was huge. We laughed so hard. The food was supposed to be Mexican. But having spent considerable time at some of the best restaurants in Mexico, the food here would be laughable if it wasn't so bad. No flavor, nothing. Really not good. And the waitress. Talk about attitude. Kept calling our friend \""missie\"" or \""me lady\"". Seriously? Let me give you a hint. You are a waitress, not the Queen. Being a waitress or waiter is a tough job so we go out of our way to be nice. Not a job that I would want. But, your job is to be nice, give good service, etc. The wait staff here needs serious traiining. I was watching one of the waiters put plates on the tables. He would neatly lay out the plates and then to position, he would put his hand in the middle of the plate, palm down, to shift if around, to put it in place. Not sure where his hand had been before placing the plates, but what a turn-off. Hopefully he just didn't come from the bathroom, or worse. This place is nothing more than an embarassment. So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place. If it lasts a year I would be surprised.",0
7146,"Could this be my new favorite bar? You bet! I've been here twice-both times were SO much fun. I had been wanting to check this place out for a while and quite happy I finally did. It's a gem in central Phoenix. Parking is a bit sketchy--we've been lucky to get a spot in the parking lot, but that was only the first time we went. This past Friday we went and ended up parking in a lot across the street, where there was a man selling ribs straight off the grill. Random, much? This place isn't much from the outside, but once inside-it's like you're taking to another realm. It oozes cool without being pretentious. Char's is tiny-I wouldn't be surprised if they were at over capacity on the weekends. Despite that, no one seems to be bothered by it being so crowded-I swear every person I encountered was super polite and friendly. I was offered a place to sit at the bar so I could get a drink by a nice gentleman who wanted to just go out and bust a move on the dance floor. I've been on a Sunday and Friday-both times Soul Power was playing. They ROCK. Usually, I'm like \""meh\"" towards cover bands, but they cover songs and make them all their own. I pretty much was dancing from the time I walked in the door until I left, pausing of course to order a drink. Overall, a great place for drinks and live music with people from every demographic! If you're a fan of Rhythm Room, you'll probably like this place.",4
25112,"Wow this place has very bad service. Stopped in for a personal size pizza had 45 min before movie starts next door. Seated no more then 20 feet from the pizza station. After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it. 15 min latter we walked out with nothing. This was the only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept. Had more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us. Really how long does it take to bake a 12\"" pizza 5 -8 min. Never again, has been 3 years since I was there before and it was so-so then, so it's not gotten better. Fool me once good for you, fool me twice shame on me.",0
42341,"I expected more of the Rosehip.. Hence only 2 stars. It was a cold Thursday night, I had a long day behind me and what I was looking for now was a nice dinner out. My husband and I had bought a itison voucher for a steak meal at Rosehip some time ago and decided to make use of it finally. After arriving at the restaurant, we got a table in the upstairs area. Ordered 2 glasses of wine and they bought over a bottle.. No big deal, it was rectified swiftly. My husband ordered a brie starter: 3 smallish triangles of fried brie which came with sweet chili sauce and salad. It was delicious, and just the right amount for a starter. A while later, our main courses arrived. The deal was for a 8oz sirloin steak served with grilled tomato, onion rings, hand cut chips and garlic butter. Instead of chips we got potato wedges - again not a big issue but I'm more a chips/fries kind of girl. Especially if they are 'shoestring fries' :) The onion rings were lovely, and I ate them quickly before they went cold. The steak itself was quite nicely cooked, but it had quite a few fatty bits which I had to discard. It didn't have as much flavour, but the accompanying peppercorn sauce was nice - it wasn't too strong or peppery. There was no garlic butter, but to be honest I didn't need it anyway. It was time to pay.. They brought over the bill and we noticed that they had charged for a full bottle of wine instead of 2 glasses. They apologised and brought over the right amount of change. The waiting staff were all very friendly and that was the positive thing about Rosehip. Food wasn't quite up to my liking but perhaps I've been spoiled by Kyloe when it comes to steaks.",1

26585,"We've been to Boneheads several times over the past few years. The food always tastes fresh and is seemingly healthy. The problem we've run into the last few times has been the service. The last time we went it was slow and unwelcoming and we said we wouldn't go back. And then we ran across a coupon. So today we went for lunch after probably a 6 month hiatus. The restaurant felt unclean - the tables were sticky, the napkin dispenser was sticky and broken, food was sitting on a lot of tables well after folks had left. We were there at about 1:30, so it's safe to say the lunch crowd had come and gone and the staff just wasn't picking up leftover food. So, with food sitting around and sticky surfaces we didn't have a great impression when we sat down at our table. Also - it's clear that they've updated the large menu board, but the menu copy that's taped to the counter in front of the register is still showing the old prices. Details, details, it all matters when you're trying to convince me that your restaurant is where I should spend my money. As we're sitting there waiting for our food (which IMO took too long based on the crowd in the restaurant), a young man came in wearing all workout gear, sweating and dirty. He walked right behind the counter and into the kitchen where he was joking and chatting with the staff. I never saw him wash his hands and he was touching the registers, counters, and the supposedly clean staff members. He placed his order from behind the counter and with his sweaty clothes on, he waited for his order to appear in the \""order up\"" area - right where the cook was preparing my lunch. No, I'm not okay with some sweaty guy standing next to where my lunch is being prepared. I don't care if you're the owner, the owner's son or a random employee. You are not clean and that is a HORRIBLE impression on customers. Our lunch was okay, but frankly, I was disgusted with the sticky surfaces and sweaty visitor to really enjoy it. I'm afraid that what was once a great restaurant when it opened has now become a dirty alternative to what it was in it's prime. Boneheads - if you're going to have a kitchen open to where all of your customers can see what's going on, I suggest to treat it as such. And while you're at it, clean the tables, pick up old food and replace your napkin dispensers. Gross.",0
36720,"Havana is a great little corner bar at Sycamore and Shiloh Street. Fashioned to resemble a Miami style outdoor bistro, Havana serves great cocktails and has a wonderful wine selection. Whether you're a regular or visitor to the Mount, when you walk into Havana the bartenders great you and ask what type of alcohol you prefer, then suggest specials, and exotic offerings. Don't feel like sitting at the bar? Relax in overstuffed sofas and easy chairs in a living room style setting. Huge doors are opened at night to let the cool air in, and you can look Dow Shiloh Street and see part of the downtown skyline. Of course rum based drinks are a speciality here at Havana, but I go for a glass of Melbac when I'm not in the mood for anything else. Overall, Havana is a great place to unwind after a long day at work and you just want to relax without being bombarded with loud music and bar flys.",2
24725,"Los 7 Compadres has a variety (20) of combination platters for about 7 bucks. Between my wife and I we had 7 items on our combination platters, which we shared. 7 has been a recurring number for us starting with the OYE at Malee's. Including the rice and beans, the sour cream and the guacamole this gave us an astounding number of possible combinations for each bite. A bite of chicken enchilada.

All of the food was good. Portions were generally large. I found the tamales to be the least satisfying item. They were a bit dry and the dominant flavor was just the spice of jalapeno. Note-even the mild here has a real bite. Overall I'd give them 3.5 stars. Good enough for a return trip.",2
42672,"After TCC Family Hair Care on 19th and Northern closed for good I was faced with the daunting task of finding another place to get my haircut that is halfway decent and not overly expensive. After prodding around on Yelp.com for a place that has been reviewed (not negatively) and and isn't too expensive, I found Joe's Barber Shop. And I have to say, I am glad I did. This place bills itself as a \""European barbershop\"", but I am not actually sure what that means so I have no idea if it is an accurate description or not. But clearly Joe and his wife Alla are from somewhere in Eastern Europe and so are the other gals that were working there when I stopped in on a Wednesday morning to get a haircut. The chairs there are big and comfortable and there was a nice TV on and plenty of seating for other folks. It had a welcoming vibe I would say. Much more so than a SuperCuts or other franchise family salons. It was also clean and looked like a business that was well taken care of with good equipment. I was glad to see this. The haircut was great. The gal who helped me (can't remember her name) did a really good job and really took her time with me. She gave me a nice razor shave on my neckline and a great cut overall. I was super happy. It was $12.00 + plus tip and I got a nice 30 minute haircut, which was meticulous and one of the best cuts I've had in years. I was almost mad upon leaving when I realized that I wasn't getting nearly the time or the cut at other places I had been to around my neighborhood. Bottom line: Joe's is great overall. They gave me an exceptional cut at a great price and I left the place thinking \""I am definitely coming back again\"". Maybe I will do so earlier than I am used to as I feel like I can get good service and it makes me want to come back sooner to keep my hair looking neat and trim. ...and I don't EVER rush to come out of pocket for anything, so that's saying a lot.",3
19419,"So I was on my way home from work and I didn't feel like cooking and was craving Asian food. I was happy to see this place on my way so I decided to stop and check it out. As I walked in I was hit with the smell of stale cigarettes which really made me want to turn around and walk out but I was only ordering to go and it may have been another customer that walked in before me so I headed up to the register area to check out the menu and place my order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were many options of different Asian cuisine. I'm a sucker for Thai fried rice so I decided to order that and crab angels (crab puffs). Again I was just ordering take out so when I got home and opened my fried rice I couldn't believe how much was in the container. There was enough for 4 meals!! The crab angels were just ok I have had better. I would really like to give this place more stars simply for the amazing Thai Fried Rice I got, but it was missing the pineapple that I was craving and that it said it had on the menu. I will go back and try this place again and possibly change my review to a 4 or 5.",2

33722,Went here with some friends and drove Lambo Guillardo 250. What an amazing machine. The only thing was I felt like my drive instructor wasn't that great. He seemed more interested in getting me through the track and on to the next one rather than really giving me the top-notch driving experience that I paid for. Just attitude really and that makes a big difference. Didn't really seem to care much about my experience. That part was a dissapointment and it didn't help me to feel comfortable in an already stressful experience of driving a really expesnive car 120+mph on a track.,2

I personally found it overpriced and not worth it. We sat in the bar area and the bartenders (there were 2 and we were the only people in the bar area) seemed annoyed they had to serve us. Then we ordered appitizers, which were pricey and good, but not great. (The mussels were really good though!)

I walked up to the cashier and she was friendly and welcoming she gave me some ideas and help me decide on what to get the Mu shu wrap.....AWESOME....

19172,I have been going to glad nails for over 5 years now and usually had a ok- great pedi depending on the nail tec. Last month I received horrible service and pedi. It was done by one of the male tecs. He performed the wrong pedi and told me that I could not change to the sea salt one because he already put lotion on my leg. Then he put the wrong color on. No tip and never will be back. Just found a new nail salon on Happy Valley Rd. They are awesome and use hot rocks in their pedi service.,0
32836,"This place is like food for giants, not unlike many places in Vegas. The portions are huge and if you finish it, you are not any average person. The menu was also huge. My friend and my boyfriend had a hard time deciding, but we had plenty of time because the place was packed. I would've rated this higher if I didn't have such a bad experience with what I had. I had one of the house hashes, which I was not familiar with until it was served to me. Roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash turned out to be that with some crispy potatoes and some fruit and biscuit. The chicken was amazingly dry and flavorless. I took the rest home, but I don't know why because I knew I wasn't going to eat it. I couldn't even salvage it with some seasonings because it was so dry. My boyfriend's sage fried chicken eggs benedict was good, but still not enough for me to go back for it. My friend's quesadilla was like a high pancake folded in half, it was pretty hilarious. He liked his plate too...so I guess I was the only one. Next time, if I ever go again, maybe I'll ask the regulars what they enjoy eating. Still, I'd rather be able to try out the menu and not be afraid it'll either taste great or disgusting.",1

The whole order of food, was sub-par, at best. The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest. The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese. The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good. For the prices, not a real good value. For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's. Nice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot. Will not return.",0

28306,As a Hawaii local who has been away from the islands for some time I was excited to discover a poke shop here in Vegas. Their claims had reached all my expectations however In the end I found myself disappointed at the quality. They had claimed to have fresh fish but being that i am a fisherman l can tell you it's not as fresh as they claim. It was nothing like hawaii in both taste and preparation. Portion wise I felt ripped off I find them to be a bit greedy at an unreasonable price. For the most part I found this place to be unsatisfying and upsetting imitation to my standard of poke so just a heads up if your expecting it to be like island quality personally it's nothing like hawaii,0
34528,"Okay, downgrading my last review. One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment. Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine. Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street). I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe. IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around. I had five bites and sent it back. The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way. Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken \""Vings\"" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about. While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk). She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with). If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to. A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least. instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage. Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips. Someone else will appreciate it I am sure. Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won't hurt your profits that bad!! Peace out. Find your sizzle!! Attorney Steve",1
22101,"Great barbershop! When I first started going here I was new to professional haircuts, always got mine at places like great clips. This place is the real deal though. I get my hair cut by Isreal and haven't been disappointed. The cut is great, the shave is great, and the customer service is great. Very friendly atmosphere in the shop. Highly recommended.",4
45657,"We ate here twice while we were staying at Ti. The first time we were here the service was pretty slow on getting us our drink orders, they may have been understaffed though. The food was good. One day I had a Ham and Cheese Omelette which was grea! I actually liked that they placed one of those pre-sliced pieces of cheese over the top of the omelette. Some people probably wouldn't like that, but when you've had a night of drinking, something about that 'fake cheese' (as I like to call it) is sooo good :) Second time we were there I had the Cobb Salad, omg, fantastic! My husband had a Club Sandwich the first time and it was very good too. The portions they give you are hardy so you're payment won't go to waste. Defiantly give this place a try! 3 stars because there was some food on the ground and we had a sticky table one of the times.",2
22900,"Golden Spoon is so much better than all the self-serve frozen yogurt shops in the valley. It's the original of the modern \""fro-yo\"" craze in the valley, and remains the best. Not only is the yogurt more flavorful and more solid, but you also get a lot more for your money. Golden Spoon charges by the size, not the ounce, and the employees are very generous about the amount they pour into your cup. They have no problem letting you sample flavors, and they mix however many you like. And unlike the self-serve places, the yogurt doesn't look like a giant glob in an oversized bowl by the time you sit down to eat it. The only negative is that you may be dealing with a line during busy hours as you wait for the employees. And yes, the plastic spoons are colored gold.",4
47542,"When i am craving chinese food I am not looking for a big plate, small portion type of place. I am feeling glutinous and want some freaking general tso chicken and some hot and sour soup- and a lot of it. This buffet delivers. Everything hot was legit. They even had fried chicken, pizza and \""fresh\"" dinner rolls. They had hibachi style grill with a ton of ingredients. I didnt do the salad bar as I wanted to be fat. The sushi was better than grocery store sushi but not like anything you'd find at Red or Muramoto. Some of their doctored up rolls with a ton of sauces on them were ok but some were \""i'll never try that again.\"" My best advice is proceed with caution. and dont expect the kind of sushi that would cost a $15 roll in a different restaurant. If you got the chinese meat sweats this place will not disappoint.",3
37366,"So far, I've only had the chance to go for the NYE Prix Fixe as I'm out of the country, but goddamn is this place good. I know that a Prix Fixe can't speak to the overarching quality of a restaurant, but everything was perfectly done that night. From the seared scallop app to the trimmed BBQ duck entree, the food was glorious. The service was also attentive, and humorous. Definitely gotta check this place out again when I move back to MTL.",4
42462,"Neighborhood place similar to Moe's or Chipotle. I find those places a little better since there are more options. For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra. Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos. Also noticed that Thursday's specialty pricing is get a free fountain drink with your burrito purchase. Not too shabby! I'm not in this area of town much, but suppose I would possibly return on a Tuesday.",2
43144,"It is unfortunate that Custom Built Pizza will be closing by the end of the month. It is a great concept. You pick the toppings you want on your pizza and they build it right in front of you. Then they pop it in the oven and in a few minutes, you have a pizza, custom built to your preferences. The staff is very friendly and make you feel like family. We spoke briefly to the owner who expressed a desire to re-open at a new location. I hope he does.",4
39928,"Staff was nice and the place clean and inviting, but the actual service was terrible. Rushed, half-assed and overpriced. Pedicure was around 15 minutes, person seemed annoyed that I didn't want to pay the $5 extra for their sole treatment, and just rushed through the rest. Manicure was truly terrible, there was no cuticle softener used, soaked for literally 2 minutes, and just said my \""cuticles were hard\"" so he basically just put polish on. Will never return.",1

I think if you have a table/cabana, this might be fun to lounge but it's too packed to feel like a pool party. It felt like Bourbon Street on Mardi Gras with a lot less clothing. I had a good time but not sure how I'd feel if I had to pay for it.",2
15322,"The food was very good and different. We started with the guacamole which was very good and tasted fresh. For dinner, I ordered the Pollo Relleno which was absolutely delightful. A chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, corn and goat cheese, surrounded by a poblano cream sauce. The mashed potatoes were unique and had a bit of a kick (in a good way) they were guajilo mashed potatoes and the accompanying vegetables were delicious. For dessert we had the flan which was a bit rich, but still very good. We went on a Saturday evening around 7:30p, the place had a couple private parties going on but we opted to sit in the bar area, as it had quite a bit more atmosphere than the dining areas. Parking was tight, but it looks like they are now using the available lot in the back which provided a ton more additional parking.",3

49452,"10/23/14 10:00 PM My wife and I were up in Las Vegas doing some shopping today, about 6:00 PM heading towards the I-215 to head home, I remembered there was a Popeye's Fried Chicken ahead, we had never eaten at a Popeye's so I pulled in for a light dinner. We went in to eat and were greeted by a very nice and helpful young man (named Maliq) we had never been in a Popeye's before and he and a young lady (named Chelsea) were so nice, helpful and patient with us oldsters, anyway we ordered and shortly Chelsea called us up to get our order. At this point I asked Chelsea to write down her name and Maliq's name so I could include their names in a post on YELP and at that point they had earned their company a 5 star rating and they still deserve it. The food was extremely good and also would have earned a 5 star rating on YELP. Now for the 1 STAR RATING that I'm giving the store... As we left the store, I held the door for a couple entering so my wife got a couple steps ahead of me and as I turned around, I saw my wife falling off the curb and onto the concrete drive-thru lane. The problem was the outside building lights were off even though it was about 6:30 PM and dark outside. The only light on the sidewalk and drive-thru lane was from the inside lights which was minimal at best and we were virtually walking in our own shadows. The walkway and drive-thru lane are both the same tone of grey concrete and in the minimal light both blended into what looked like a ramp instead of a 6\"" curb, the curb wasn't painted, a total disregard for customer safety outside the building, especially with the drive-thru lane right up against the building on three sides of the building, very poor design. Lights turned on at dusk, a $6.00 can of yellow paint and a $0.99 paint brush a concerned and \""on the ball\"" manager could eliminate any problems like this. I went in and asked to speak with the manager, young women came to the counter, I explained to her that none of the outside lights were on and told her about my wife falling off the curb...... Her reply was,\""OK, I'LL GO TURN ON THE LIGHTS\"" WHAT..... not one \""smidgen\"" of concern for a customer, my wife's condition!!!!! I said thanks for the concern for my wife, I guess Popeye's doesn't #1, train there \""MANAGERS\"" or #2 the company has no concern for the health or safety of their customers. Anyone with a lick of sense would #1 be concerned about a person that was hurt. If anyone got hurt on my property, my #1 concern would be the persons condition and what I could do to help, and #2 eliminating what caused the accident, but I guess these days, for the most part, people are only concerned about \""self\"", you see it in grocery stores, freeway, just about anywhere, people have no concern for their fellow citizens anymore, this is another example of someone with no concerns for anyone except themselves. I was so disgusted; I vowed to never go into a Popeye's again! ========================================================== 11/6/14 Well, it's been about 2 weeks and no response from corporate at all, only response was a call from the manager who offered my wife \""a free meal\"", ya like I'm going to drive 70 miles one-way for \""a free meal\"" and said he would check back. This company, local or corporate, doesn't gives a damned about the pain that my wife is going through due to their lack of concern for their customers well being. I can only wonder if this attitude extends into their kitchens and food quality and preparation, I'm sure their concern for health and safety stops at the front door. 11/12/14 What a looser outfit, the manager from the store said he would call back and see how my wife was doing, what a friggen lie, never heard a word back from the manager, no response from anyone in their coporate offices. No concern for their customers at all. I'll bet the lights still aren't turned on at dusk and I'll bet they have made no attempt to mark their curbs.",0
39380,"Strange beginning to my debut here. The owner had stepped out when i arrived around 1pm on a Sunday, so i was left trying to order from the cook who doesn't know a lick of english (hello border patrol). He didn't understand \""#1 and #2 to go, but he did say \""let me call my boss\"" so he calls his boss who didn't answer the phone. Five awkward minutes later, i yell out \""uno y dos and adios\"" and the cooking got underway finally. Oddly enough, he asked in English if I wanted cheese. Both the shredded chicken and beef were tasty, but the edge goes to the beef, although both needed more peppers and onions and the promised garlic wasn't too prevalent. The chicken was kind of mushy too. The cornmeal pancakes were the best part, so i will probably focus more on veggie stuffings which would let those shine through more. The hot green sauce had much more flavor than other green buttermilky stuff, but gotta use that lightly. The cheese was a good addition for 50 cents.",2
6761,"By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. Eat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode.",4
44643,"Union makes me think of an upscale flea market. Is that weird? Meh, to each their own. It's a great addition to this mall, I think it needed a little \""hip\"" flare. This is it ! There are a lot of hipsters and great locally owned shops, locally owned is what makes it what it is. A bunch of upscale boutiques put under one roof? Genius. The bike store has to be my favorite. Everything is on the more expensive side, but you have to somewhat expect that at the Biltmore Mall right? There are great places with knick-knacks for your home, also pricy. But it's super fun to walk through and if anything you can pick up some inspiration. There is a restaurant that I cannot remember the name for the life of me, but it's a little cafe at the very end of the \""strip\"". I have gone twice on Saturday afternoon's and it's never overly crowded, or crowded at all. That is not to say that their food and drinks are not delicious. Because they are. :) I've had the mimosa and the Caesar salad, both were great! Caesar salad was very crunchy which is my favorite, I hate when it's soggy. I definitely like Union and will be back, I especially like that I can park for free for the first two hours. If I go over that it's because I've had too many cocktails.",3
44694,"I've been waiting for this new place to open since spotting its construction phase. Finally had a chance to check it out last night on a first Friday since it's the only time I go to downtown LV. I was kinda intimidated at first since I'm not really used to seeing people in downtown all dressed up fancy and $hit. I felt under dressed but hey it's downtown. Who dresses up to go here? I was really impressed though with the decor of this place, from the \""postered\"" up wall, chairs, chandelier and so on. And damn, people here are good looking. Never been in a place where my neck went sore from turning heads from these stylish attractive ladies and no homo but the guys here are good looking too, haha. My friend Morgan was the Dj that night too, spinning all the great underground hiphop with beats that got everyone vibe''n and getting down on the dance floor. One thing I didn't like though was the drinks here were expensive, something you'd expect from the strip and not downtown LV. Ordered my first organic beer (Samuel Smith) apricots which deducted $13 bucks from my already light wallet that night. Gotta admit, best beer I've ever tasted though. I'll definitely come back here again though and dressed up all stylish next time. Overall, I recommend this to everyone who hasn't been here yet.",3
41449,"Here's the truth (which I'll always give you), if I hadn't gone to California Taco Shop before I went here, I probably would have given this place another star. Since I have...it's A-OK. Which I always have to remind myself, is not by any means bad. It's very tiny, with only two real tables, but they offer a great take out service so it makes up for the tiny dinning accommodations. Besides, if you're like me, you inhale the burrito you purchase in 2.5 seconds and you're done, so it wouldn't matter if I had to stand and eat it. I ordered the steak burrito. I really wanted a shrimp one, but there are no seafood options on the menu. The other menu option missing is fresh tortilla chips. Total bummer considering they bring you a fantastic spread of regular salsa, salsa verde and jalapeno's. I could have used something to dip in it! So the next option was to slather my burrito in it. I thought the burrito itself was good, but definitely not a giant one you'd get at Cali Taco Shop or Reyna's in the strip. It's more of a taco size, you'll need more than one if you have a big American appetite like I do! The steak was a little too salty for my taste, but was cooked just right. The rice was really the winner of the burrito. It had just the right amount of lime added. Loved it! Would I go back? Sure, why not. But I probably wouldn't order the steak again and I'd hope they have chips next time! Plus, it's a fantastic addition to the neighborhood!",2
5186,"We ended up at Komol when we couldn't get into Lotus of Siam and it turned out to be a satisfactory alternative. Komol is a Thai restaurant in the same shopping center as lotus of Siam. It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good. We started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut soup. This is always so different in so many restaurants. There was lots of spicy red powder floating at the top of this soup. They're pretty serious about the zing here at Komol. I can't really rank it among my chicken coconut soups. It might be near the top. I have to have it again. Then came the beef salad, which for me was the only disappointment of the night. While the beef was tasty, several pieces were really tough to chew. The tomatoes also seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that ripen on the truck on the way to delivery. The two entrees we split were both excellent. I ordered the mixed seafood in panang curry and it was all good. All the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked. The curry had great flavor and precision. Ted ordered the beef basil in a brown rice and it was also nicely done with a great mix of flavors. Corkage was $5 a bottle.",3
39913,"I was so happy when Vaqueros expanded to this location. The same people who own the one on 18th Ave and Southern also own this one! This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch. The burritos are always quickly served and are humongous for the price. If you dine in, there are free chips available. I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice. This isn't a very fancy place but it's sure to curb your Mexican food cravings. PS- They make a killer Super Nacho/Fry (which should be shared unless you plan on going into cardiac arrest).",2

Without exception, this KFC franchise (I assume its a franchise store and not company owned) is consistently inept, unprofessional, and unorganized. Always a wait for something, which typically means the owner cares more about minimizing food use and cares nothing about their customers. Moreover, any half-intelligent employee is never there a month later. Just returned from there and apparently the shift lead woman cant count - got 8 \""chicken bites\"" when I ordered and paid for 10, and 3 of those 8 were visibly overcooked. I returned on principal to let them know, and this shift-lead lady got mad at me...as if I would drive 5 miles home, eat 2 \""bites\"", and come back 20 min later WITH the 8 in the box looking to scam KFC out of 2 \""bites\"".

29758,"So, one of my Meetup groups had an outing planned here that I wasn't able to make but the name intrigued me. Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related. However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website. I was impressed with what I saw. I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach. I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night! I said to myself, \""Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"" One of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed! There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide. I thought to myself, \""I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"" My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed. So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G. When it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw). Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu. Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil. The wings were okay but I loved the fries. Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing. I'll definitely be back here. The food options are just about limitless, reasonably priced and the service was awesome. I say \""YES\"" to Soul Gastrolounge and you should too!",3

They do have a snack bar with a good selection of food & snacks that are decently priced. For $6.50 you can watch 3 movies. The 1st one starts around 7:30 (a little later in the summer) and there are 2 showings after that. The kids normally pass out towards the end of the 1st movie, then Mommy & Daddy can relax and watch another movie together. Tonight we watched Kung Fu Panda 2 and our 2nd movie is about to start.

35151,"After so much initial Yelp praise, I decided to drop into Nourish to give it a shot. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan or glucose or lactose free, but I am a pretty healthy eater and enjoy delicious food that also happens to be good for you. Nourish seemed like it fit a great need for its niche -- the only similar place I can think of is True Food -- but it fell flat. For starters, it's a good thing they have flavored waters, because their regular water tasted funky. Salads are very tasty but super small - appetizer portions at entree prices. Sandwiches are a much better value, but you can find better at many other places. The sweet potato fries aren't bad, for being \""air fried.\"" Without that caveat, head-to-head against real fries, not so much (and, come on, isn't ordering sweet potato fries over regular ones already being good enough?!). I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious! The setting is very casual and comfortable, and the service was great, but it's the food that brings someone back for a second time...and I can't say I plan on returning.",1

And nothing outstanding for the price either. Portions I think are big or at least enough to share. The main thing with this place is the service, I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars. The service is just slow, inconsistent and dreadful. By the time we got our food we didn't care and just wanted to leave. A formal complaint was actually made at the end. Save this place to try on a busy date night when they got something going on and it might be worth it. I don't suggest coming here for a quick lunch or entirely for food itself. It has location, a vtg vegas feel atmosphere and I don't drink but it also has booze too. However just for the food and the service alone would not be worth the trip.",2

One thing I DO have to say is, they had the BEST snow crab I've ever had. The texture was good. Not mushy or cakey. Not super salty or watered down like the stuff you might find at buffets. And it had an awesome sweetness to it. I enjoyed it more than the lobster. And I love lobster over crab! Great food. Check. Good drinks... check... ...totally worth what you pay for.

24622,"As the smaller, yet newer sister property of the Wynn Empire, Encore was the culmination of 2 years and 2 billion dollars after the 1 year anniversary of Wynn Las Vegas. Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various restaurants and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property. A recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn. With 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all. Room accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better. The casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival. On the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-nightclub-las-vegas-2) but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit. Folks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sinatra-las-vegas) and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas). Wazuzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wazuzu-las-vegas) is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5) but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality. Lastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act. While I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",3
12900,"My bf and I had brunch here last Friday morning after arriving to Las Vegas from San Francisco. We chose this place because of all the good reviews here, but we were definitely not impressed at all. The food was mediocre but definitely compares to Denny's status with a marked up price. The presentation wasn't even that great. I had the ham and cheese omlette and my bf had the mushroom omlette and added chicken, which was very dry. The ham on my omlette wasn't even \""fancy\"" ham it's regular sandwich had from the grocery store. The omlette menu was very simple and not a lot of options. On a good note the hashbrowns were good and I might go back and try the crepes maybe that's there best dish.",1
44543,"Holy salty food, Batman! 0_o I had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter. It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us. We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order. I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise. It's very noisy when that place it busy! I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling. I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing. For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco. My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling. He had the red sauce on his enchiladas. At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband. We paid around $32 for everything. The inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio. The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall. It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it. My grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story. I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating. That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was! Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it. The buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too. Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top. I'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done. This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place. :/",1

12279,"I've been going to The Orleans to see movies for fourteen years now. I've never gambled at The Orleans, so my review won't deal with that aspect of the casino. The movie theater is great. Both the theaters and restrooms are usually quite clean. I've never had a problem with the screens or picture quality. As for refreshments, they have a selection of binned candy that I appreciate, although I usually only have a soda. The Orleans itself has several places to eat, but my favorite is Fuddruckers. The first time I went to Fuddruckers was because I had seen it featured in the film Idiocracy. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their veggie burger.",3
9802,"If there was an option to review without any stars this would be a great case. I was very upset and chose to not tell her how I felt. I went in for a brow wax and came out with thin uneven eyebrows. I was very specific that I just wanted a clean up and did not want the actual eye brow messed with. When I looked at them I noticed half my eyebrow was missing. The woman tried to tell me that I was not looking at them correctly. How can you employ or authorize someone to do a service they cannot perform? I will never ever walk into Regis again. Biggest mistake ever. **side note: i was washing my face and my left eyelid burned, i looked in the mirror and saw that either i have a burn or my skin was lifted. Seriously? Shitty eyebrows and now skin missing??",0
40359,"Delanie's is my new favorite coffee place, which says something because I have so many in Pittsburgh. A few times a week, I like to walk a few blocks and have a coffee at their nice cafe on Carson. The staff is always friendly. The coffee is good, but the breakfast sandwiches are better. I love breakfast. I could eat brinner every night. That being said, their veggie, egg, and cheese sandwich is one of the freshest I've ever had. Be warned, a few of their frozen drinks taste more like milkshakes than your run-of-the-mill iced coffee. If you fancy a treat, try the \""turtle\"", a sweet frozen concoction of peanut butter, chocolate, and caramel. It's not a bad place for a meetup, a break, or just somewhere to read/work for awhile. If you're a regular, it's worthwhile to join their loyalty program. You will quickly accumulate free drinks!",4
20990,"On my first visit to Phoenix, this restaurant was across from my hotel. At first I was skeptical: would Greek food in the southwest be any good? Then I told myself I was being unfair to Phoenix and decided to give it a try. I should have listened to my gut. For a restaurant with \""Greek\"" in the title, I'm amazed at just how bad the \""Greek\"" food was. I tried both the moussaka and the pastitsio, and both were completely underwhelming. First of all, both were topped with Italian-style tomato sauce and Parmesan. No sign of the bechamel that is supposed to be atop the pastitsio (even says it on the menu!). The \""macaroni\"" filling was actually giant pieces of penne, and there was no hint of Greek spice anywhere. The moussaka was even worse: same Italian sauce and cheese on top, but filled with what appeared to be peelings from zucchini and eggplant, all rather al dente. I sent it back. The pita wedges and the hummus on the appetizer plate were very good and the best thing I ate. Service and management were both quite good; they kept my water filled and offered to bring me something else for free when it became clear I wasn't happy with my food. I won't be back.",1

The story of Capriottis coming west to Las Vegas is a great American Success story. I have spent all my time at another Capriottis location when in Las Vegas, and on this day I gave the shop on Paradise a shot. The food was good not great, the sandwich was carelessly made and the store was not exactly clean. I still recommend to anyone to eat here, but I am throwing it out for the owner to put a little more scrutiny on this location.",2
48560,"The service was terrible. I could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear. Not very classy. Needless to say the food was good, but you can get great meals anywhere in this city. Service is what sets it apart. Not a fan",0

After a good night out, I'm expecting something that will hit the spot and make me sleep like a baby after. Don't come here if that's exactly what you're looking for. Too bad there's really no late night spots in the valley. This is the time when I really miss New Yorks street vendors with ridiculous lines at 3am or Chinatown where you can eat to your hearts content & fall asleep in the back seat while someones driving you home or the diners where the menu is filled with so much choices but guaranteed a hearty meal or.....

23904,"Been twice and had a decent meal both times. the last time I ordered the \""dirty southern\"" burger...and must say it was hard to eat. Didn't taste bad, but it was messy and had to use a fork (taboo for any good burger). That said, the burger is \""dirty\"" so perhaps that was why. My best rating is the beer selection...great brands of local brews and the bar staff is good at making recommendations and pairings.",2
38998,"Not great. Some mediums and some lows: Ceviche - not that great. Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well. Beef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry. Seasoning was not noticeable. Carne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry. Nothing memorable though. Chips and Salsa Bar - the best part. Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a \""spicy\"" red, and a \""smokey\"" red. Tacos al Pastor - not that good. Rice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out. I do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream. All in all, qualifies as a \""Never Again\"" stop. P.S. Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either.",1
38877,"I had a SpaFinder gift card and through them I found this spa. I had a massage and a facial. The facial and Patricia deserve 4 stars. The massage and Desiree deserve 3.5 stars (just because it was more firm than I like). The spa deserves 1 star. What was good: The technicians were professional, well groomed, provided good service, were knowledgeable and they were not chatty. The beds and linens were clean, they had nice robes, and the bathroom was clean. What was not so good: The building was really bad - more like where you would find a shady accountant than a spa. The carpet is filthy in the lounge area and the massage room. The water provided isn't in little bottles, or even nice cups. It is in mouthwash sized dixie cups. It didn't have that spa smell, it had a slightly weird smell (maybe the old building?) I know their prices are slightly lower than competitors and that is probably due to not paying high rent. But overall this facility really seems too low rent for any business with the title \""Spa\"".",1

The bean were mush. I've had canned beans with more texture and better flavor. The rice was salty. The chile relleno was profoundly sub-par having very little chile to it. I also couldn't tell if it had been fried or not. The sauce that went with it was okay, but not close to the chile relleno at Las Palmas in Santa Cruz. The taco looked like it needed a lot of love. The meat was oddly seasoned and had gross, mushy texture to it. The taco shell itself was probably store bought. Ick. Overall, if I do go back I'm trying something else.",1
38446,"I'm not a big fan of this particular location. Just as a background, I've been a Chase customer and have 2 active accounts with them. I went in trying to cash a larger check and the new accounts specialist was just down my back trying to convince me to open another account. I nearly felt forced to give my number, so I gave it to him quickly in hopes he wouldn't hear one of the numbers. Apparently, it wasn't quick enough because he literally called me for 2 weeks straight and left me a voice mail to come back in and open that new account. Also, while at the teller... I asked about a sign I saw on the window at the front. It was some feature where you can scan your check and deposit it via phone. I asked the teller if this was something that was available for the Blackberry. Instead of knowing the answer, the teller had to search for the answer. I guess that's good that she didn't just BS me with an answer, but at the same time; I feel as if that is something that she should have known. My last complaint: After the first set of doors is a room where there is 1 atm. Under the atm... an overflowing plastic trash can that looks as if it has been neglected to days. Not a good first impression, especially to those who are non Chase customers that are considering opening a new account.",1

They offer more flavors and more toppings at way cheaper prices. You get nearly double or triple the amount for the same price as other places. Plus, you get to pump the amount of yogurt and apply topping yourself, which not all other places offer. The only drawbacks this place has is that it is too popular so lines can be 5-10 minutes long. Also, there is no indoor seating, and there are only 3 tables outside. It's disappointing to beat the heat with frozen yogurt only to have it melt while you eat it in 100+ degree heat...",4
42293,"Amazing dinner. Escape to Vegas with my men left us wanting hearty man food. Who better than Ramsey to deliver? Get the sides, Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes. Steak cuts rib eye and NY strip to die for. Don't be late- they will hold it against u.",4
38678,"Not sure what the deal is. I hear great things about this place from reliable sources but I was underwhelmed with my burger. Don't get me wrong - it was a decent burger and the bacon was, I dare say, delicious. But it's bacon. Think the issue with Five Guys is twofold: 1) They seriously need to put SALT on the patties. Yeah whoever the five guys are....season your food. Like In-n-Out does. In-n-Out even has a sign you can see from drive thrus reminding their cooks to season the patty correctly. Clearly no such reminder at Five Guys. I've eaten at two locations in two states and this is a trend. A bad one. 2) I'm all for picking your own toppings - I guess. But how's about a burger you can just order off the menu? Because, honestly, the first time I go to a place I usually ask for the most popular or recommended item. Makes sense right? You go in there and what do you do? Order the burger with everything? Just what you like? Is this really a decision you can take time to make with 20 people behind you in line and you not wanting to be like the idiot in front of you who, LITERALLY, took 3 minutes 26 seconds to order his burger with 20 people behind him. I timed it cause my uncanny douche bag spider sense tingled and knew it would happen. Fries were ok. Next time I'll try the cajun ones. They need to use smaller fries and hotter oil because it isn't crispy like McDonalds fries. Or double fry them because the fries do not have a crispy exterior. WTF is with that. Also, not necessary to carbo load so many fries in one order. I'd rather pay less for less fries and not have to dig through fries to get to my custom ordered hamburger. But that's a minor complaint. But have to say it's way better than Fatburger, BK (obviously), McDonalds (obviously) and a whole host of those little hamburger joints that also serve breakfast. It's also more expensive than these other places and not sure it's worth it. Oh yeah...their buns are the definition of mediocre. Seriously, they should rename it Four Guys and send the fifth guy to learn how to make or buy decent bread. It's awful for a $6 hamburger. In-n-Out, on the other hand has epic hamburger buns.",2

For them to claim that they vacuumed there was stuff all inside my car still and for them to say they wipe down the inside they must use dirty clothes because they missed a whole side of my car and you could see all the dirt and dust left inside of it. For it to be a so called manager special I was kind of pissed I spent pretty good money just to have a car that was still dirty. Wheels still had dirt on them the car still had pollen on it. So it was a pointless wash! Did I mention that it's a manager special?! Damn shame, I'm sure their manager doesn't want their car like that.

We've been coming here for years and it's always been really good, but the scallops were a bit overcooked this time around. Everything else was really good and this was the first time that's happened, so I'm not overly concerned. In fact, we like this place so much, we haven't been to another hibachi restaurant (you know the one) since discovering this place 5 years ago. If you're thinking they are too pricy for a night out with the family, be informed that they will cut their portion of the main course in half for half the price. With the soup, salad, fried rice, and veggies, it's still enough food. We walked out spending $120 for the four of us before tip.",4

7693,"My child was enrolled in the pre-k program, at this location, for about a month. During this time she had trouble with another little boy in the class making violent and sexual remarks toward her, including threats to have her head smashed in with a hammer and her private area licked. The Center director talked to my child and the little boy, and came to the conclusion that nothing happened. In her follow up conversation with me she implied that my child needed counseling, while dismissing my concerns and allowing this little boy with known disciplinary issues to remain in the classroom. My child was pulled out of the classroom and placed with 3 year olds! Not comfortable that my child would be protected in the environment, I decided to pull her out and enroll in another local daycare center. We have had no further issues since transferring and ALL inappropriate words and actions have stopped! She is no longer afraid to go to school in the morning. It saddens me that one child who clearly has issues would be allowed to taint an entire room of children.

Seafood special was a pink snapper over stuffed cabbage roll of saffron rice, sausage, scallops, etc. My wife loved it and has anointed the Foxcroft chef-the best seafood chef in Charlotte. Simple is better, he never over does it and produces great results. I had the new menu item Beef Bourguignon with a potato gnocchi, a hearty and flavorful dish, the beef a bit chewy, but still good.

42036,"Man, I needed a quick fix after a night downtown and we literally stumbled upon this place. I can't really say much as I was really drunk, however I do remember that the place is pretty small. There's a bar countertop and maybe a few chairs. Little quaint place inside the casino. The cashier who helped us was cordial and she even joked around a little with us which made it a great interaction. For the food, I got the mushroom swiss burger. I can't remember the cost, however, I remember paying around 10 bucks for that and a shared appetizer of some sort. What I do remember though, is that the burger was not flavored. I thought it was super bland. I the mushrooms were perfectly carmelized and the swiss did bring a little flavor, but the star of show (or supposed to be), the burger, wasn't really seasoned. I really did enjoy the fries however. They were super crispy and shoe string-ish. My preferance! All in all, it was an ok kind of place. Not much to choose from that late at night but it did the trick!",2
1206,This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee.,1
41153,"Wow! I cannot believe this place can charge this much for a so-so burger. It was small, flavorless, and I swear I tasted freezer burn. I laugh at the fact that I spent so much and received so little in return. Oh, did I fail to mention that it also cost me $1 per topping?! I do not understand the rave about these burgers. I also ordered a half-shake, at least that is what I call it. A $6 mini-shake. I can understand if the quality is great, but come on. The shakes at McDonald's are just as good. This place is not a fine dining establishment, so why must I wait 22 minutes for a so-so burger, fries, and a mini-shake? Oh right, there were two of us. Sorry, but I was really let down. I just wanted a decent burger and to enjoy this place. I will not return. It is a shame with all the clientele running through Town Square, you would think they would step-up their game.",0
44479,"3.5 stars, not the 2.5 that I was expecting. I was pleasantly surprised. With all the terrible reviews, I wanted to stay away...but sometimes, you gotta take a chance. I dove in head first with my friend last night, and it was none too shabby. First, let me say that they are definitely paying attention to their reviews on Yelp because the service was spot on. It was fast, friendly, and the manager came over to see how we were doing. A-OK in my book! I ordered turkey meatballs with pesto, and melted the cheese on top. The meatballs were tasty and the pesto was delicious, too. It was a creamy pesto, though, not usually my favorite, but it was alright. The major gripe I have about the place is the prices: $9 for meatballs, fine. But saying that they come with french bread when they literally come with one piece of crostini is not cool. $3.50 for a soda, absurd! $1.50 for cheese on top of the meatballs, mmmno. And finally, $7 for a side of garlic parmesan fries? I want fries dipped in golden ketchup for that price. It was not worth it. Stick with the meatballs, sans cheese, skip the garlic fries, and just drink water and you'll have a great time.",2
17701,"We've been here a lot since our first visit. Unfortunately, I have to lower the star rating. While service is good, and we like the Friday and Saturday night bands playing, there are a few things that are starting to bother us about CKs. The only food items we really enjoy are the fries, the wings, and the zucchini. We've tried different burgers, sandwiches, and a couple entrees and it's just boring and bland, or the portions are too small for what you're charged. The burgers are pretty good size but their sandwiches aren't and regardless of which you get they seem to gyp you on fries. Last night my sandwich came with 4 big fries and about 6 or 7 little skimpy fries. My boyfriend ordered the hatch chili burger which we were told was an open-faced burger. While that's fine, they didn't give him the top bun. Generally an open-faced sandwich means both the top and bottom pieces of bread are laid on the plate and all the other messy ingredients are poured over top and you eat it with a fork and knife. CKs only gave him the bottom bun. When I looked over and saw that he had barely eaten half of it and I knew he didn't like it. This man tears through a good burger. He said it was really bland. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all. He was also gyped on fries. We've noticed this happens every time we order burgers or sandwiches. The same seems to be happening with their appetizers. The first few times we came here we would always order the zucchini and the wings. They used to fill the $8 basket of zucchini up, now it's barely enough for us to share. The zucchini is so freaking good but it's no where near worth $8 or ordering it anymore. Lastly we're getting a little tired of waiting for the bands to play at 9:30pm. We really enjoy the music but with our very early work schedules we're used to going to bed quite early so on weekends we're ready for bed by 9:30pm. Lame for us, I know, but there are many other bars or restaurants where the music starts at 8pm or even 7pm. Also, their website isn't accurate anymore on who's playing. We went last night because the website said Broken Toys was playing and we really enjoyed them last time. However it was a different band who never introduced themselves and who weren't as good. Sad... While we still like CKs, we most likely would eat dinner else where and just come for a couple drinks and some music...if we're willing to stay up.",2

39273,"I feel like this is the P.F. Chang's of Mexican food. I think that they are still working out a lot of kinks in service. Our server was very sweet and pleasant but she was clearly overworked and the kitchen was slow. The salsa tasted heavily of lime and no other flavor. The chips were warm at least. Ordered their house specialty of black chile pork. I was expecting something redolent of spices and maybe even chocolate. We got instead something tasty in a reddish oily sauce. The pulled pork quesadilla was good, (and reminded me a lot of the black and blue quesadilla with its sweet flavor at Sam's cafe). The burger was actually the best, with a juicy patty. Ask for a side of chipotle rance, it'll make the skinny fries taste out of this world. Not a bad choice at the biltmore, just not a destination place and not what I would go for if I was craving Mexican food.",1

Christopher doesn`t disappoint and I have been to his other restaurants, and this one is on my top list to return for more!

2666,"At first the experience was good. The rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. After talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have (a Pitbull) and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. Even their own website said on that property listing (and others) there were no breed restrictions. However after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...They refused to refund the app fee (due to it not being refundable) even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..Also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. The manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. Most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. Be very cautious in using this company. I personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them.",0
38339,"Definitely a different experience than most. I didn't like this restaurant. Came in late at night and sat at the kitchen bar. Nobody else was there. Good place to sit if you're solo because you can watch the kitchen. I love kitchen seating because the action is really fun to watch. But this was a very weird experience. They probably had 4-5 people on the line and they didn't communicate with each other- at all. Every. Complete and utter silence, which I thought was so strange. They were not a-lovin-their job. They were just robots going through the motion. Maybe the kitchen is set up that way on purpose, but I have never seen a kitchen not communicate- at all. I think it came across in the food too. No love in the food. I had a flatbread that was really, fell flat. Nothing to it. I did have a braised veal pasta dish that was good. The service was okay. I had a decent wine flight. All in all, it was a strange experience that I didn't enjoy.",1

It is effectivly a junk shop parading as a speciality items shop. A quick look on the window will have you spotting cool little things like military medals, collectables and other oddities, but once you get inside you will realsie this stuff is really just a load of old junk that nobody wants, yet the owner (a very grumpy old man, who frankly is rather scary) feels as though its worth a fortune, because that is what he charges for it. After spending some twenty minutes picking my way through a load of broken, damged and generally just crap stuff I spotted something I might have actually wanted - an old street sign that as far as I could tell had been stolen from a wall somewhere. I was told that it would cost me \u00a330, and when I refused the guy tutted and effectivly ignored me for the rest of my time in the shop. I later spotted it in the all intising window, along with the rest of the good stuff that the guy refuses to sell with a whopping \u00a345 price tag. Avoid this place, its all junk anyway.",0

Be careful, you can easily spend an entire afternoon lost in a treasure hunt! Great prices and pretty decent condition of most of the items, too! I will continue to go back and search for new treasures!",4

10581,"When in Las Vegas for work, this is where our corporate account has us stay. It is nice... simple and clean. Large TV's in the room, complimentary bottled water in the room, starbucks coffee, great shower pressure. I wouldn't stay here for a vegas vacation, probably, simply because I'd want something a bit more lively. Great for if youre in town for work, however. Adequate fitness center- dumbbells up to 60lbs... Full circuit cable pulley machine and a lot of cardio---around 15 cardio machines (ellipticals, bikes and treadmills) free fruit in there as well... Pool area is pretty simple, but very nice- there is a bar out there, (where this nitwit paid 5.75 for a Redbull!) :- / There are cabanas and a good amount of lounge chairs, pool and hot tub. Really, no complaints about this place, Other than, I do agree with another reviewer- the walls are thin, as I could hear people to the side of me- not partying, but just speaking loudly.. A great place to stay if you're looking for something nice and clean, yet w/out the party hard vibe. It's hard to go wrong with a Westin, however. I believe there is also some type of daily happy hour too.. FREE food, etc... but I haven't tried that... Friendly staff, as well.. that's important.",3
24362,"I wasn't impressed by the food here at all. All the other restaurants were busy since it was a Friday night. This restaurant didn't have a wait and I wanted to try this place out since I've never ate here before. I ordered the Thai shrimp & scallops and I was very disappointed. It sounded good on the menu, but didn't taste as good as I thought it would. The scallops were undercooked and there wasn't enough curry sauce. The portion was small too and the price for this dish was $27. Definitely not worth that price. The drink I had was the pineapple paradisio which tasted way better than the food! They gave me a complimentary dessert which was the pineapple creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was actually in a real pineapple for my birthday which was delicious since I love creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but I'm not going to this restaurant for food again.",1
24451,"this was actually a very nice place to grab some sushi. We were seated right away. Server was very nice and attentive. the menu look satisfying. however I could only comment on the Cali-roll and the veggie roll, both probably the best I've had. I could couldn't try any of their sake, or other drinks, because I had forgotten my ID. (I look young for a 24 year old) the atmosphere was very active, and lively. I would certainly return for more sushi in the future. I don't know about price, because I didn't see the bill. lol I'm spoiled. sorry",4
48701,Very slow...and there's not very many people. Didn't bring food for two people. When we asked why they said the cooked accidentally closed our order. No real apologies. Food ok but not worth the lack of service.,0
43807,"I can't say anything about the food/drinks(as we never got to order any), but the service here was by FAR the worst I've ever had. I went with a group of people, and we were seated outside. This was understandable, as they were busy, but we had planned on staying for a while. I figured asking to be moved inside when they had open space wouldn't be a problem. I was wrong. After waiting over 15 minutes from initially being seated, the waiter finally comes around. I asked him to be put on a waiting list to be moved inside. He very snobbishly tells us we probably can't, but he would ask. Another 15 minutes later another employee comes by and basically tells us there's no guarantees of us being able to move inside... yet I saw many open tables that they placed other people at. The group I was with and I decided to leave before even placing an order. I don't care how good people claim the food and drinks are here I will NEVER come back.",0
46270,"Staff was quick, especially considering the line they had. I don't do coffee, so I can't speak to that, but the tea was good (of course it's pretty hard to mess up black tea). I don't recommend their hot food items though. I ordered the egg, ham & cheese croissant for $8. The outside was super hot, which I thought was a good sign. However the middle was cold & I am not a fan of cold egg. For $8 and a 10 minute wait I expected my food to be cooked through. I didn't have time to ask for a replacement because it was time for my plane to board, so maybe they would have done a better job the second time. If I ever end up here again, I'm define tell grabbing one of the cold items.",1
30481,My kids use to come here a lot on Fridays after school. The last time we went there the service was horrible! They also started charging for fries and for cheese on their hamburgers. They brought out our fries before our meal. Then forgot to bring my daughters fries out that I had to pay for. The hamburgers and club sandwich were both burned. I ended up not having a lunch to eat. We will not be coming back! Very disappointed! This use to be such a great restaurant.,1
19333,"Very friendly staff and the store is usually very clean. I have seen quite an improvement in this store over the past 4 years. However, the selection of organic fruits/ vegetables is pretty small and very expensive. I don't like the fact that I go to a huge grocery store yet cannot get what I need in that one stop. I hope this store will expand their selection of organic options soon.",2
47042,This location has really gone downhill. Whoever runs the grill really needs to be retrained by corporate. Last three visits chicken has literally been black. Not just a bit overcooked but completely black and disgusting on both sides. Whenever I bring it back to have it replaced staff acts like I'm being such an inconvenience even rolled their eyes at me once. The last time I complained about it they told me I should check the chicken before I leave to see if it's burnt? Really? I don't feel it's my responsibility to make sure it's not black burnt and disgusting. Mashed potatoes were literally soup. Go to other locations they are much better wish there was another one closer to me.,0
20552,"Usually have a nice time & meal, but today they seam to of had Sunday blues. They had no sugarless syrup when they said they do. They served an omelette that was incorrect. They dropped the onion rings on the floor. At least all the servers had their usual politeness. Hopefully they get through the rest of today smoother than this morning.",2
8353,"This place is amazing.... Everything we had from alcohol n apps to desert was tender, fresh, and delicious! I had the #16, we all shared the combination appetizer, and had baklava and the Persian pastry ... So good! The chicken and baklava were my two favorites but it was all really good. I will be back for sure. Great service, great atmosphere, and great food!",4
17726,Review is only for the tacos they serve outside. They're $.99 each but they charge tax with it. I like their selection of meats like cow head and beef tongue and they've got like 5 salsas. But I found their meat to be really tough and lacking flavor. Definitely a taco stand you can skip.,1
8311,"Was taken here on a date for dinner.and the ambiance is beautiful. Since it was a nice night out, we chose to sit out on the patio (heat lamps are always a plus). I really wish they had lights on the course, so you had somewhat of a pretty view when eating dinner, im sure this would be a great place to have dinner during the sunset. I hate the corn chowder as an appetizer, and it was PHENOMENAL. Being that my date was a scottsdale resident, thats what he stated was the best on the menu. I also got one of their wraps, it was a crispy chicken wrap with honey mustard, bacon, lettuce and wrapped in a spinach wrap (if I'm remembering correctly) . I wasnt 100% satisfied with my meal, to be honest with you. The chicken was a little dry, the bacon and cheddar were lacking, but the honey mustard sauce and the spinach wrap were great! I wish I would of tried the new menu that the server told me about. darn. but if youre a golfer and you come by this course, i would check it out. Take the recommendations given by the servers though. They know what they are talking about.",3
39534,"Had me at hello. To think I may never have ever came here, given that its past incarnation, The Crags, had been one of my favourite bars around the town a few years back. It was only through a chance conversation with a Sheep's Heid waitress that alerted me to Salisbury's existence. The sister restaurant to the Sheep's Heid Inn, I would argue that the Salisbury Arms is more like the tougher big brother! The menu is the same as Sheep's Heid however as Salisbury houses a larger kitchen, it has the advantage of including the Heid's more popular specials as part of their regular menu, also allowing them three times the daily specials the Heid can manage. Three times as many! The building intself is a sturdy old townhouse built of bricks, muscle and brawn. The inside has been decked out in the manner (or manor...?) of an old American winter cabin, complete with antlers on the walls and blazing fire classily located in the centre of the room. Very swish. My last visit saw me dine on Roast Duck with Potato Dauphinoise, Butternut Squash, Curly Kale and Rosemary Sauce (see photos). Putting the unbeatable Mark Greenaway duck to one side, this is Edinburgh's duck silver-medallist. Abolutely melt in the mouth, generous portions, amazing combination of flavours. It was love. Can't stop talking about it. Jennie opted for the gammon, a meat I would rarely select from a menu, and even that rocked the boat, steering clear of the usual thin round of meat, instead presented thick-cut and juicy, with chips that required a knife and fork themselves! Immense. The old bar area is still intact with the addition of board games and live music on the weekends, all combining to make this an excellent location for a chilled out evening, or even a pre-going out meal. If the food was rubbish I would moan about the prices, but my duck was worth every penny of the \u00a315 asking price. And from the other dishes I've been lucky enough to try, they've all been worth the cash. The staff in turn are warm, friendly and sociable on all the right levels. Absolute winner. Joey's Top 5 without question.",4
27941,"We are visiting from NYC for a week and we went there for dinner at the suggestion of our concierge at Royal Palms with a promise of a nice view and live music. The Steak was superb!!! I can honestly say it was probably the best Fillet Mignon in my recent memory. Wine list is very very good, 300% markup is a bit much but I guess that is how they make money. We split carrot cake for desert and it was also out of this world. My only criticism is the cocktail I ordered was Vodka gimlet and it really had no vodka in it, so, instead of complaining about it which i think leads to just another splash of bad vodka and \""bad blood\"" with a waiter, i ordered a shot of Vodka on the side. I got about half of Merlot wine glass of vodka instead of a shot glass and they charge $14 for it! So, my drink ended up costing me $29! The steak was excellent and we will definitely come back next time we are in town.",4
13119,"Agree with the review that says it is for the 20-30 singles and that it needs a facelift, not a place to plan your family vacation!! Stay away from the room service unless you are in the aforementioned demographic & are too drunk to care what you eat & how much you pay for it. My kids were too scared to go to this pool! Find a more family friendly hotel like MGM Grand where there are great shows and a lion exhibit & rainforest cafe'. I hear there is an M&Ms store somehwere?? New York New York has a great arcade & is by the MGM Grand, too. Also, there is a fun tram that stops at the MGM Grand, but it doesn't link to the Luxor, another downer!! I'm sure there are better family experiences in Vegas than the Luxor! We were ill-informed.",0

Only recommend you go there if you have many years left in your life to wait around.",0
789,"We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp. If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it. I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor. The fish deserves 5 stars. Everything else a 3 star. I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option. Would definitely go back.",2
40290,"Think very yummy popsicles. They have many unique flavors that change regularly. I tried the arroz con leche. It tasted like horchata. I liked it so much that i wanted to try another flavor. I got pecan. The pecan had a ton of pecans in it, which gave it a lot of texture and crunchiness. When you come here, you'll have a hard time deciding too. Have everyone in your party get a different flavor and share.",3
7893,"If you are looking for any kind of obscure hat this is your place! They have all kinds of hats here! They even have stuff in storage that they can get if you need something that is 'out of season'. I happened to walk in a few days after the Kentucky Derby and what a treat, so many amazing, beautiful, well-made hats!! I was there for another need, but wow, I almost wanted to buy a crazy derby hat...such COOL stuff! The sales associate was extremely helpful; you can tell they know their hats (any genre). They are a bit on the expensive side, but nice well-made hats are pricey.",3
7444,"This place is probably the lowest priced you can find in Phoenix. And you get what you pay for so my expectations were low to begin with. We can't afford the prices of nicer motel/hotels and must stay in these lower priced places. You can imagine my surprise to find this motel much better than we anticipated. The rooms aren't the best - they're just average low priced rooms. The beds were comfy enough, TV worked fine and had some decent stations, kitchenette was fully furnished and two burners. I didn't see any roaches and I checked the mattress for bed bugs (do this everywhere!) You can't beat the price. We only stayed one night. Yes, there were some nefarious looking individuals we walked by but all turned out fine. They looked scarier than they were. For the price, I would stay here again except for my biggest issue. Very weak wifi signal. So getting online was difficult most of the time. For me it's a deal-breaker. I completed one of those online review forms provided by Crossland and mentioned my disappointment in the wifi. I was surprised to receive an email from the general manager indicating he would be looking into improving it. I hope that happens. I will stay there again if it gets fixed.",3
2011,"After visiting Earnhardt Lexus looking at the ES300h but not really getting serious I went to Bell Lexus thinking they would have a better selection. They didn't but I took a test drive anyway. After a short test drive we sat down to go over the numbers. I was unimpressed with the negotiations. Although they were polite, they seemed relatively dysfunctional. Earnhardt had mentioned incentive financing which oddly the Bell Lexus folks couldn't or wouldn't match. I went back to Earnhardt and got the car I wanted at a better price, with the financing Bell didn't (wouldn't) offer, and a better deal on my trade-in. To summarize, Bell Lexus was not really competitive on price, financing, or trade-in, but other than that they were OK.",1
25624,"The hotel for the price range and the star rating is fair. One thing i will complain about is the staff. Of all the hotel stays i've ever done (and i've had my generous share of moving around on a budget and in luxury) i have never met a most unprofessional, discourteous, and sarcastic staff who work in hotels. You ask for something (airconditioning) and staff asks for a minute (and he returns on facebook... I came back in 2 minutes and asked and was lectured to not expect it to be done immediately, while his computer screen was still on facebook. Stayed from 25-27 august 2012. NEVER STAY HERE!!!!",0
32315,"Oh, Dippin' Dots....How the 90's hath come and gone. Everyone remembers the days of walking through the mall, seeing your odd kiosk, and finding themselves dumbfounded by the tiny, perfectly orbish balls of ice cream. Now, in present day, I can enjoy your crazy treat in the comforts of Ballantyne! We've passed by this location many times and finally decided to stop in on a blazing weekday afternoon. It's a small shop with plenty of flavors. Little did I know that Dippin' Dots has branched out and started selling more than just chocolate and vanilla. Nay! There is banana split, flavors with chocolate bars, fruit flavors and a ton of others. I was astonished. It's a bit of a slow shop. One guy behind the counter (he has a rad, white beard, too) and friendly once you start chatting. There is also a Ballantyne Popcorn section in this shop. Kind of odd, but they appear to have a ton of popcorn for sale, too. Dippin' Dots and Artisan Popcorn? Maybe it's the new peanut butter & jelly. Little did we know, folks.... Thanks for keeping us cool, Dippin' Dots!",2
35837,"It will be a long time before I return to this shop! They do an amazing job on my nails every time but there customers service is awful unless your dropping at least $100 or more on service. If they're busy and you have a simple service there is no small talk (maybe with the neighboring nail tech) but they want you in and out. And if you ask for specifics like can you paint this nail orange and this one pink or something of that nature and they're running pass there allotted work time be prepared for lots of sighing and talking under ones breath. God forbid you nick a nail they'll be way to busy too correct it or make you feel foolish for nicking your nail. Oh someone else will fix it though they do pride themselves on how the nails look but not on the personable side of the transaction the girls at the front are super sweet and love to see everyone's nails. It really upsets me that they treat there clientele this way. It hurts there business and I always refer people to this salon, well not anymore. Moral of the story is good job terrible customers service even from little Kim one of the owners.",2
3984,"That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)",2
33527,"Never again. #1 - I am a business traveler, and did not have a huge amount of time to sit waiting in lines for sub-standard service. #2 - Take a bus to the rental car center. Then take another bus from rental car center to Fox location. This tidbit of information was definitely not explained when I booked the reservations. Expect an additional 45 minutes to an hour to take this into account on both ends of the rental. Once I got onto the Fox bus it should have been a red flag when the driver immediately starts making excuses and apologies for his company. #3 - We show up at the rundown off airport/off rental car center/location. (For Sale Signs all over the property so I'm not sure how long these guys will be around.) I get into line to get my rental car and the fun really begins. 14 people in line, 2 workers processing rentals. Turn time per customer approximately 12 minutes. Apparently their computer system was down. 15 minutes into the line wait and 1 of the 2 workers announces that he is going to take his lunch break. He proceeds to collect his belongings and leave. (In my business he could have collected his final check as he walked out the door.) #4 - Car was fine. Honda Accord in good condition. #5 - Return process was outdated and slow. Pull-in to leaving the location on the bus 32 minutes. The 22% savings over Hertz was not worth the time and aggravation.",0
4560,"Also known as stab mart in the military circle this Walmart is not the best by any means. However, I must admit with the increase of security recently it has made me comfortable with once again shopping there. It has been a welcome change to not have to travel all the way down Craig to the next Walmart to buy things. This Walmart does offer some things that other Walmarts' do not normally offer. In example, around holiday times and season changes you can snag some great clearance items. They almost always have some kind of clearance specials going on in buggies along the backside of the cashier stations and have a clearance aisle behind the jewelry department. A couple of downsides to this Walmart is that the service is very limited. They have minimum cashiers and their deli department always takes forever to service you. However, the service you get is rarely bad once you get it. The people tend to be friendly. I would also never recommend buying produce there. Their fruits and vegetables go bad super quick. During strawberry season I purchased two large flats of strawberries for a dessert I was making. The next day when I opened my 2 flats I found that 90% of my strawberries were ruined and molded toward the bottom. I had looked the day before and had not seen this. I have also had this issue with some of the bread products I have bought there so beware on fresh products. Overall, this Walmart could be better. There are some things such as cleanliness that could still be improved but in the 3 years I have lived in the area I have seen major improvements to what it was previously.",1
27315,"The Mission is such a fun, delicious spot! I went there for my second time on Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. We got to sit out on the back patio in the beautiful evening weather that was decorated with little white lights. Once again I wish I remembered our server's name because he was on point. He greeted our table and shared with us some restaurant and personal favorites without missing a beat on the ingredients in each dish. I started with the white wine sangria which was good, grapefruity in my opinion but I still liked it. Our table ordered the table side guacamole and the crispy pork & cola lime glaze as our appetizers. The table side guac is a MUST. They make it right there with about 12 ingredients (I think that's what our server said). It's fresh and creamy, just the way guac should be. The crispy pork & cola lime glaze was amazing and recommended as a restaurant favorite. It was something you can only find at the Mission, which I find important. For my main dish, I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos and my boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder Tacos. The little corn tortillas they prepare are yummy and in house, which is awesome. My steak tacos had a nice grill smokey taste to them. They serve three small, street style tacos but they fill you up quicker than you realize. I recommend ordering a side with the tacos however. My boyfriend and I split the grilled street corn appetizer off the cob as our side. That corn might have been my most favorite dish all night. The pork shoulder was succulent and prepared perfectly. One of the gentlemen I was with called the place \""froo-froo Mexican.\"" I have to agree, it's upscale Mexican but don't let the deter you from trying it out because the flavor profiles and combinations are unique and phenomenal. Be sure to go when you're willing to spend some money so you get the full experience of The Mission!!",4
34796,"I should make it clear from the beginning that I had a hotel comp and didn't pay for the meal. If I had paid for the meal, I would be furious. So here it goes- my partner and I ordered 5 items to share: The sliders never came out The braised short rib smelled and tasted foul. We each took a small bite and never touched it again. The breaded and fried green beans weren't horrible, but they weren't interesting either. I'm not sure what the dipping sauce was trying to be. Also, I think the oil in the fryer needs to be changed. The flat bread took almost 30 minutes and was bland. The only dish I would recommend is the duck tostada- but even then I have to say the duck was so bland it might as well have been over cooked dark meat chicken. On the positive side- we ate at the bar, and aside from the sliders never coming out, the service was nice. The bartender was pleasant and quick with our drinks.",1
40963,"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM. A little busy, but the service was fairly quick. Large selection - mostly bar food. Girlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili. Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty. Prices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek.",1
38397,"I just recently went to Burgatory and I have to tell you that I was extremely pleased with our service. I think that I'm a little \""burgered out\"" due to the proliferation of burger joints in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. In order for me to give high praise, you really have to do something outstanding with your menu, service, decor, etc.... Burgatory provides a nice environment, solid menu options and great service. However, when you compare their offerings to other burger joints, it's just equally appealing to the other burger restaurants. We went during their \""Happy Hour\"" last Friday where you can order their appetizers and beer at half off the menu price, as well as $5 well drinks. Great deal if you can get there between 4-6pm. Because of the price, I decided to go with appetizers for my meal. I ordered the Fire kissed Sriracha wings, Moo Better Blues sliders, Sea Salt and Herb Pommes Frites and the Bangkok Steak Fries. My daughter and I split the apps and my sister and niece ordered individual customized burgers. Additionally, my daughter, niece and sister ordered milkshakes and I ordered Mike's Scratch Margarita. The fresh cut fries were exactly as I expected them to be: hot, crispy and well seasoned. That may not seem like much, but I can't tell you how many times I've been to a restaurant that specialized in \""burgers\"" and then the proprietors screwed things up by serving wishy-washy frozen fries. Ugh! The wings were well done and the sliders were tasty. Additionally, the $5 \""Rita\"" had some mojo behind it. (You know how \""some\"" restaurants water down their well drinks on special... This was not the case. Whew-wee!) My only compalint was that the Bangkok Steak Fries (actually tempura fried portobello mushrooms) were on the greasy/heavy side. Good idea gone wrong because of a leaden tempura batter. Tempura batters should be light and extremely crispy which allows the food being fried to shine through. This did not happen. All in all, a very pleasant visit and a very reasonably priced meal.",2
26464,"In short, they do a nice job, but even when they are in a slower period, you need to plan on waiting an hour. When they are busy, which is all day on weekends, plan for two hours. They apologize if you can find anyone in charge, but it hasn't improved over the last year. Sorry 7 Hills, I can do it myself faster. I'm done here, which is unfortunate.",1

47709,"After reading some positive reviews I wanted to try Buddy V's for some decent Italian food. It's a nice place with a nice view of the strip, with the neon lights flickering in the background. Here is what we had: - Grandmas Meatballs. These were pretty tast but our order was cold. I know they are not made to order but you expect them to be warm. -Calamari Fritti. You basic calamari with 2 slivers of a banana pepper and grilled lemon. Another dish that came out cold. -Lisa V's Linguini and white clam sauce. This dish has the most balanced flavors and a decent amount of clams. This was the 3rd dish in a row that was cold. I would have mentioned it to our server but he wasn't around much. -My mother in laws shrimp scampi. The one dish that came out warm . It had pretty good flavors but not the best scampi I ever had. My mother in laws is much better!. Where most authentic Italian restaurants might offer you freshly grated parm you had to ask for it and it took a few minutes to let the food get even colder. We also asked for some bread, mainly for the scampi since it had a nice broth build up in the bottom of the bowl. The waiter looked as if I was asking for ketchup at a steak house. Another dissapointing Italian meal in Las Vegas, my search continues!",1
34258,"We were here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm, and we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. We were okay with that, but as we walked to the bar there were a TON of empty tables!!! Why would there be such a long wait just for two? Anyway, we found a table at the bar to sit in and have dinner. We shared the mini corn dogs, Dirty Chips, and the bison burger. The corn dogs were good. The Dirty Chips were pretty fantastic. It was a huge appetizer for the two of us. Between the corn dogs and chips, we didn't need the bison burger. The bison burger was dry. We ordered it medium rare, and it lacked juiciness. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice too.",2
1084,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars. But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them. Eating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about. Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure. So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences. The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient. I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences. No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service. My only \""complaint\"" is that I have carried out a few times from this location. A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \""less important\"" then maybe the dine in patrons.",4
38071,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered: White Pizza - Fantastic and straight to the point. Cheesy without being overwhelming and heavy. 1 slice is all you really need to reach contentment unless you're someone with an over-sized appetite. Pizza is always coming out fresh. Huge globs of ricotta, total score. I prefer my white pizzas a little on the creamier side, but this was good enough. Can't complaint about a $5 slice if you're in Vegas. Great for late night eats especially if you're staying at the hotel. OVERALL: Great people, love the man behind the counter. Quick service as well.

Most of the evidence comes from the (slightly derranged) individuals who spent a lot of time looking at the lake. Or devising machines to proove their point. You can proove anything with facts these days. And photos. After your Loch Ness Discovery troop over to the Loch itself if you have time.

29635,"With so many frozen yogurt places around town, it is hard to stand out. Berrygood does, but not necessarily in a good way. First off, they aren't self-serve, which means you can't control how much or little you want and you don't pay per ounce. Instead you have the choice between small, medium and large, and just four flavors. Plus, you pay extra for toppings! So, it was rather pricey and flavor limited compared to most place, and since there seems to be a frozen yogurt place on nearly every corner nowadays, I don't really think it is worth it. But, I must say the flavor I got -- Mango -- was berry... ahem, I mean very... good (I had to pun, sorry). And, that, is the only reason I gave it one more star than it deserves.",2
48026,"Wow! I wish I had read these reviews before going in for my oil change today. I checked in on Yelp but did not read the reviews until just now. I can totally relate. I had contact with 3 different female customer service reps. Only one was semi courteous, the other two? Zero professionalism. No greeting, no thank you Miss Tzannos, nothing. While checking out, a fourth representative overheard my conversation regarding an error on my bill and she came right over to adjust my invoice to 0.00. She is the only reason Earnhardt Dodge is even getting this 1 star. Then I was referred to Alan Clark. I briefly spoke with him regarding my alignment issues. No greeting. No \""Thank you for your business\"". No customer service whatsoever from him and 1/2 the team that was there today. (After reading another review below about how Alan Clark is dishonest and lazy; I will NOT be dealing with him at any point in the future.) Alan told me that I would be charged $69.00 for them to evaluate my vehicle for the alignment issue. Really? I think I'll wait and call back on Monday to speak with a supervisor. (If that will even help) Hopefully if not, there is another Jeep dealership I can visit.",0

33702,We shipped a package at this store and there was a problem with the package. When we checked the UPS website it states the package was damages and someone would contact us. 5 days later and no one has called us so we contacted this store. The woman we spoke with was rude and would not help us. She said they would be in contact with us in a few weeks. When we asked to talk to the manager the woman on the phone said no. Very rude people work here and do not care about customer service at all.,0
4157,"I went here on friday night because I was celebrating my graduation with my family. We had to wait like 45 minutes but, it was expected for a friday night. When we got seated, we got seated by a very nice hostess. She was polite and talkative. She seated us in a nice booth. We waited a little while before we were helped by our waitress but when she did help us she gave us what we wanted. She seemed very distracted and like she didn't give us all of her attention but its understandable she was busy so no worries. The food was excellent! better than I expected. I had the Terriyaki sirloin and it was a great! I loved it because it was sweet, and I was still able to taste the meat. I will come back again.",3
7634,"My husband and son have had their hair cut here for years, but no more. The cuts have been fine, but their business practices leave much to be desired. They constantly change their marketing/incentive programs, and refuse to honor what they had in place before. Last year they advertised in both the Mountain View Football and Wrestling fundraiser cards, and then refused to honor the terms that were on the cards. \""We're sorry, it should've stated this _________.\"" Today, I went to offer a punch card that already had 5 punches on it (need 6 for a free cut), only to be told they don't use them anymore, and they wouldn't honor it. So, we paid for 6 haircuts with the promise of a free one in return, and now.... nothing. I asked for the owner's contact info, which they wouldn't give me. They took my name and number instead and promised to get back to me. We'll see if that happens, but I'm not holding my breath. My husband starting going elsewhere about 4 or 5 months ago, but I continued taking my son here purely out of convenience. No longer, though. I'm tired of the bait and switch.",0
10293,"There is a lot of Indian Cuisine competition but this place does have great service and great comfort food at a good price. I really enjoy the neighborhood competition, Mint Indian Bistro and Origin of India more though, but there is something about this place that continues to keep itself standing, despite this. I would definitely go here if I had more friends who like Indian food or ate out as much as I used to. This place is a lot older. But I live right up the street from this place and if I got tired of frequenting Mint Indian Bistro on Flamingo, I would go here to get a change of setting. I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans. My friend likes this place more than Mint, so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians... Again, because it sits in a terrible neighborhood, the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes. I don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but I hear they are pretty good. The decor has antique wood and has a fine dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water glass. But, this seems to be a common theme for all of the Indian Restaurants, they are very properly set. The Indian food buffet is a good deal, but if I had patience I would order off the menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful.",2
11898,"Good stiff vodka based drinks here. The bloody mary is almost a meal in itself. I like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booths for groups.

32523,"I recently brought a Groupon for $20 for $40 worth of food (1Groupon per table, sucks). Overall all i can say was what a bad experience. From the start i called to make a reservation as stated on the Groupon but was told no reservation needed. As my friend and i walk in 808 sushi the only available seating was the sushi bar and a table next to the door, we took the table next to the door even though we were already cold. ( the table wasn't cleaned off). As we waited for them to clean off the table i look around and it seemed cold and dark, not a welcoming place. The server asked if we were doing happy hour or groupon, we told her groupon and she handed us the menu for the Groupon. :(. I was very dissapointed about the menu, i expected more variety of Rolls and appetizers. After ordering we over heard a table talking about still being hungry and complaining about waiting over 15min for their check. When it was our time to get our check we waited less than 10 min. We order 2 California rolls, 808 Roll, 6 piece Screaming orgasm , miso soup, shrimp tempura. total was$ 48.75 with Groupon discount it came to $8.75. I gave them $20.75 after waiting another 10min for my change back i got back only $9.75 :/ ya i was confused for a moment myself (i guess they wanted to take some of their own tip out of my money first). honest mistake maybe !!! . But we were cold and to disappointed to stay any longer. Wont be returning !!!!!",1
43425,"I had been waiting months to try Sweet Addiction and was thrilled when my husband said we could go. I went to a similar place in Huntington Beach and was raving to him about how much he was going to love it, ice cream and cookies, how could it go wrong? But it did. Upon arriving I noticed the decor and I actually enjoyed it, very modern and clean, and it looks like homemade paintings on the wall- tucked behind the refrigerator that is holding the soda and water. The smell of cookies was ridiculous and I was excited to start my cookie, ice cream creation. I then noticed how small the ice cream bar area was and that the cookies were stacked on a self that was only about 2 feet from the ceiling. After canvassing the place, we decided to try and place an order. Like I stated previously we had never been here so my husband was taking a little longer to order to which we were told to \""step aside and let the next person order,\"" there was one person behind us and she was ready either. When I looked at the menu and saw a cookie sundae\"" option it read \""2 scoops of ice cream, one cookie, and hot fudge\"" that sounded like what I wanted minus the fudge. While placing my order with the tall blonde girl behind the counter I said \""the cookie sundae please with ___ and ___ ice cream and ___ for the cookie, hold the hot fudge,\"" to which the girl replied,\""so do you want whipped cream?\"" me: \""oh no thank you,\"" her: \""so thats not a sundae, just get the 2 scoops and a cookie\"" ..... Alright so yes, I suppose I should have realized that a sundae would indeed include whipped cream and fudge, however, I have been in the customer service industry long enough to know that you do not speak to a customer that way. I then heard the same girl speak to another customer in a rude manner. Then noticed that the male that worked there was standing between the back of house and the counter fidgeting with whipped cream and clearly avoiding with any sense of work duty-which always annoys me. Have some work ethic people!! The ice cream was alright but a little freezer burnt and the cookies were hard (probably due to the fact they are baked in the morning and left on an open shelf the rest of the day). I have to say that I probably would have been fine with this place if I hadn't first been brushed aside and then treated like an idiot. I also don't like the fact that no one that works here wears a name tag. Personally, I can go to a restaurant that has the best food ever but when the service and attitude of the people that work there is poor and down right negative, I will not waste my time or money to go back.",1
45377,"Decided to try this place after looking it up online......Never Again! Horrible food. Server was very unaware of what was going on. Every question asked about the menu she had no clue. You can definitely tell the difference between someone who enjoys their job and someone who is just there for a paycheck. Not to mention food being unavailable. We ordered the Jambalaya, Coconut Tofu and Jerk Tofu..... horrible. The rice was not cooked all the way. Food was hard and very bland! The Jambalaya was straight out of a Zatarain's with some Jamaican seasoning... as a business owner, professional chef, West Indian, world traveler and foodie this was by far the worst food I have ever had... overpriced and underrepresented..... Waste of money... Staff needs to be trained better on customer service....",0
33452,"So my sis and I came here for our \""28th\"" birthday. I had planned out most of the events/ reservations with April Nakaji, who ROCKs!!!! Thanks for your time and efforts, and sweet demeanor April!!! We got there after the Cosmo Limo picked us up from the airport. Dusty was gracious, and provided us with a welcoming experience. We then got there early (9:00AM), early, and didn't have room yet, but were able to check in. We already planned on spa day, and so had reservations for mani/pedi, scrub, spa-ing all day (See Sahra Spa review). We had our fill, but not before taking amazing pics of the dogs and the stilettos in the foyers. We then went to lunch at the Wicked spoon...awesome! What fresh farm to table cuisine, lots of fresh veggies, and fruits concocted in the most amazing presentations, with such dishes that I will try to find and order o the internet! I am picky about eating fresh, raw veggies with my meals, and I just adored the gratifying steamed and lightly steamed veggies Wicked Sppon offered as part of the entree, and even as an entree... We then went to the Spa to have a Shellac Mani-Pedi, and Salt Total Body scrub. There was some patron there trying to convince us in the steam room that we should have spent our money elsewhere i.e Aria, but beware of competition in the form of blondie girls looking to lure you!! Weird!! I know!!! We went to the spa, the cold plunge, steam room, sauna...see my review under Sahra Spa! We then went to our room. I paid for a 1 bedroom suite, but April (my sweet concierge) decided to upgrage us to a Bellagio Fountain View (OMG). I ordered a dozen mylan balloons to be there for my twin sis, and a delish fruit basket, thanks for setting it up, including our bags. That night we got ready and went directly to Encore for La Reve!!!! Super Duper!!! You HAVE to see it!!! We came back, stood in line at Marquee for about an hour...a little flirting got us NO where, so we left and went to Bond...see my review there...LOVED it!! We then went back to Marquee...slipped the \""guy with the clipboard\"" a $20 and got in to the front of the line....IT WAS 2:20 BY NOW, FYI, and the lines were outrageous...we danced our souls away until 5:00AM, and OMG did we have an amazing early birthday celebration in Vegas... I can't wait to come back...I'll definitely come back just with my twin too!! Look out for us!!",4

28472,"For some reason, as some point in my life I thought Stereo was a decent club. I think that had something to do with being in first year at uni, the first year away from home so everything in Edinburgh is big and shiney and new. Because Stereo is most definitely not a decent club. Its one of those clubs where if your not a Chav, then you have no business being here. Unless you like to make out with random strangers while heavily petting said stranger, you're probably not going to like this place. I have seen people thrown out of here for almost completing the deed on the dance floor. Yeh, its that kind of place. A really annoying part of Stereo is their bouncers. They are on some uber power trip and seem to think they are the secret service and your trying to enter the White House or something. They grill you on where you have been all night and who with and why. Its a little extreme. However the saving grace of Stereo (which is why it gets two stars, not one), is the little known white room on the top floor. Generally the Chavs are too drunk to make it all the way up here so its usually empty. And on a Friday night its 80's night! So if you gather a huge group of super fun friends you can head up to the white room and have your own little private party. Complete with 80's music! But the rest of the time this place is awful.",1

I'm down to 20 bucks and gulped my Scotch. Now he's whispering at two and they're ALL looking at me. I begin to wonder if this might be my last hurrah. I ordered another Scotch and ignored his stare.

48344,"Is it possible to rate an establishment with less than 1 star? The security team here is a joke. I came in with a pocket knife (I am a woman mind you) only to have it confiscated at the door. This wasn't too much to ask as I understand the need for a safe environment. I do want to make it known that I carry my pocket knife everywhere and have never had it confiscated at any of the bars on Fremont. I forgot to get it back that night but came back the next day to grab it. The only person that was available to talk was the barista that worked the counter at the coffee shop. She informed me that the knife was potbelly locked away in a safe because she couldn't find it. She took down my information and told me she would call once my knife was found. She called me with in a few hours to let me know my knife was there and safe. I was unable to come on Saturday night because I had to work. I came back on Sunday and Monday during the day and found the establishment closed on both of hose days. Because I work and go to school full time, tonight was the first day I could come back. I was greeted by security and waited for about 15 minutes for the manager to come from upstairs to open the safe that my knife was supposedly kept in. After waiting for the manger for 15 minutes, the manager informs me that there was in fact no knife in the safe. This left me very confused. After gathering my thoughts and confusion, approached the manager with my question about the whereabouts of my pocket knife. After a few minutes the director of security became involved. The director went on to ask me why they would even bother putting someone's knife in safe to begin with. I was just as confused about that as he was. I went on to ask him why several people would tell me that my property was put in a safe and why the where about of my property we're know one day and unknown the next. I also asked his if he was concerned about his employees taking property from customers, specifically weapons. Both gentlemen were unconcerned with the fact that a weapon was missing and that a customer was very unhappy with losing property at their establishment. Both of these gentlemen need to be taught a few lessons on how to talk and deal with customers. I am very upset and am looking into how I can get this resolved. This security team is very unprofessional in every way possible. I can get past the value of my knife, what's harder to get past is the unclear communication about the situation and the ignorance of the incompetence of their own company and team.",0

Then we got our food and my order was completely wrong. By the time they made another and brought it out everyone else was done with their food and I had to get mine to go. The waitress took the check off the table, I was assuming they were going to give some sort of discount being as I had to take my breakfast to go now, but nope, she came back and there was no offer or mention of my inconvenience. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food I did get to eat was good, but I won't be going back.

For this kind of upper tier fast food Mexican (as compared to Taco Bell or Del Taco, which is lower tier), Rubio's blows it away completely Doesn't suck at least.

16857,"Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto. What were they thinking? The prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? Anyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all.",0
10598,"My girlfriend has been raving about the Rainforest Cafe and her experiences that she has had with them in Chicago, so when we saw one was available at the MGM Grand (which is just a quick walk from the Excalibur where we're staying), I got a bit excited based on that. Being inside the MGM Grand, I expected expensive but the cheapest meal item I found was $15+. That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money. Now, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a \""rainforest\"" of sorts. The entire thing is animatronic and features a storm that goes off every half hour or so. Honestly, I found the whole thing laughably cheesy and couldn't believe this is what we were paying extra for. The entire thing would have been impressive If I was much younger and living in the 1980's.... MAYBE. As for the quality of service, it was mediocre at best. The table next to us was seated and ordered later, but had their drinks refilled before mine. The waiter often disappeared and it took my girlfriend asking him to get drinks refilled. Food was okay, nothing special and nothing I'd pay extra for. All in all, not impressed.",0

The lines tend to be long unless you're a Diamond or 7 Star member. Good thing about the price is that mimosas and champagne is included for brunch. The service is on and off.

This apple store is filled with distracted, spun out, mediocre employees whose best skills must lie somewhere outside the field of their employment. Their heir of entitlement impedes their work ethic, and makes for lazy, half ass jobs from people who, in past eras, would be genuinely thrilled to help you. I brought my computer in dec 24th, stayed for two hours as the techie assured me that i was wrong about my computer and that it was an easy fix. His solutions only exacerbated the problems, and so he kept the machine for a deep, 24 test of the SOFTWARE. this is what he told me- they would be testing the SOFTWARE, along with general hardware issues. He said I should have it back by the 26th. I called mid day the 26th. The operator seemed confused by my call. \""OH!...uh yeah they are still fixing it\"" TRANSLATION: They had not even started. Keep in mind, I told them from HOUR ONE that i was leaving for New York on Thursday, the 29th, so i had to resolve the issues by then or make arrangements to ship. Basically, i spent the next few days...all the way up to ONE HOUR from going to the airport, on the phone with them, dealing with what they actually did, s what they SAID they would do. No one in the store seemed to be communicating with each other. I even had to remind them to install snow leopard, not leopard...which is what i had installed on the drive before it failed. \""your computer is ready!\"" oh, wiat, no its not, because you didnt bother to see what OS was on there before you installed the new drive. thanks. After buying a new hard drive, and new memory, the two things their Geniuses said were causing the problem, I come home to find that my computer still has the same issues. I'm not sure I understand how the software could have passed this amazing 24 hour test they did. I'd place a rich bet that they got distracted in their testing, and once they found problem X and Y, they did not complete the mission, and thus I am left with less money, less time, and less patience with apple and anyone who is not interested in delivering excellent customer service.

2842,"Our German Shepard got a hemotoma in his ear. It's basically blood filling his ear flap. We took him here because it's the closest vet to our home. As far as the visit itself, it was average. The only treatment they did was to drain the blood with a needle. No big deal, figured ok, issue resolved, keep pressure on it and it will eventually heal. WRONG! After doing some research online and calling other vets, what they did was basically pointless, the ear is filling back up with blood and the issue will have to be fixed with surgery in order to resolve it permanently. Guess what this POINTLESS treatment cost...$400!!!! The exam itself was $75 and a flippin' bandage was $53!! We are FURIOUS!! Not only did they do nothing to solve the issue, they completely took advantage of us in our worry for our dog. We have called for quotes for the actual surgery that will resolve the hemotoma to several other vets in the area and the surgery will actually be less expensive than what these ridiculous people charged us for doing jack-sh!t. Oh! And when we called them to tell them the hematoma came back they wanted to charge us $40 for the follow-up. If you have any concern for finances, DO NOT GO HERE!",0
17562,"I don't get it. After 2 visits, all I can say is Point Brugge completes the triumphant of \""Restaurants That Start With The Letter \""P\""' that Pittsburghers inexplicably revere and line-up for. Pamela's and Primanti's being the other two. My brunch cassoulet was an over-priced and over-cooked combination of white beans, duck confit, and soggy bread crumb topping. Seemingly void of the bacon and sausage described in the menu. As well as any French bread for mopping up the bowl. For the portion size, paying about 1/3 less may have been acceptable. I don't even recall what I had on my first visit, but clearly it wasn't anything memorable. Atmosphere-wise, not my thing either - too loud. Tables aren't cramped too tightly together at least. Service is generally friendly and genuine. Think I'll stick to brunch at home....",1
7,"So.Much.Fun! I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!",3
22351,"I've heard this is the BIGGEST hotel in the world. If they're counting the Venetian and all the shops connected, I think they might be telling the truth. The rooms are all suites, so they are also large. As described in other reviews, the rooms have both a sleeping area and a sunken living room area, in addition to the large bathroom with vanity and bench pair and separate toilet area. The room would be great for lounging with a few friends or a lover. Since I was by my lonesome (work thing) I personally enjoyed watching the Treasure Island show across the street with fireworks. The bed was amazing, apparently a Sealy from the card left on the nightstand. There are two gyms that are free to guests - the larger with a climbing wall! I'm grateful that I got to partake the special Prestige lounge area with amenities including a conference room, free wifi, and private check-in. Also included are special food and beverage times (free breakfast, cocktail hour, hour dourves). There was no champagne check in as advertised... but that could also be a consequence of the work thing. I look forward to going again and highly recommend to anyone who can afford it.",4
30243,"This was my first stay at the Hyatt Place Mesa and can honestly say it was a really pleasant experience. I usually stay pretty close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport for the convenience, but decided to venture out and stumbled on this place during my last business trip to the Phoenix area (June 2009). Based on how clean the lobby, hallways, elevators and room were, this hotel has to be relatively new. Front desk staff was quick in greeting and even quicker in check-in. I was put in a king size bed room on the 3rd floor. You really notice how clean the place is when you first walk into the rooms. When you walk in, to the left is a small wet bar with mini-fridge, sink and a coffee maker that makes individual cups of coffee. Unlike most hotels, they Hyatt Place doesn't fill the mini-fridge with ridiculously priced mini-bottles of booze or M&Ms...the mini-fridge is empty and is there soley for guest use. Next is a small desk that sits across from a living room area with a sectional couch with an ottoman to toss your feet up on. Of course, every room as a 42\"" flat panel HDTV with HBO and some other HDTV channels. The bathroom set up is a little weird in that the sink is outside of the bathroom, and the bathroom only contains a toilet and shower/bath...which may be crowded for a family of 4, but is perfectly fine for the lone business traveler. They provide you with the typical Hyatt Portico Spa brand toilettries. The bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room is controlled via a digital keypad. The fitness center is relatively small, but has enough cardio equipment to squeeze a run in...besides, it's not the brightest idea to run outside in the Phoenix heat in June. This is not a 5 star hotel by any means, but it is not meant to be. It's utilitarian for the business or leisure traveler. Plus, I always think it's funny that a lot of the higher-end hotels that I stay at while on vacation routinely charge you for Wi-Fi/Internet access and never give you a free breakfast...but both are offered gratis at the Hyatt Place. So kudos to Hyatt Place for accomodating the business traveler. The hotel was pretty empty during my stay, which leads to the only downfall of the Hyatt Place Mesa. This hotel is about 20 minutes away from the airport and is tucked behind the gigantic Bass Pro Shop and Mall right off the 202 highway, so you pretty much need a car to get to anything around the area. It is a little off the beaten path, but what you get in return makes up for that. Plus, being this far away from the airport, you never hear the roar of those annoying airplanes. Friendly staff, prompt check-in, free Wi-Fi, free breakfast, free parking, business center, comfortable rooms that are very, very clean, and a 42\"" flat panel when you just need to kick back after a busy day and unwind by squeezing in a little ESPN Sportscenter before bed. I'd definitely come back to this hotel.",3
14949,"BRAVO! I was so impressed by this show. First of all when you walk into the Wynn you feel like a million bucks and this venue is no different. The music, the lighting, the water, and the stunts were amazing! I am definitely going back to Le Reve the next time I go to Vegas. I like how the seating is round so practically every seat is a great seat. If you sit too close in the \""Splash Zone\"" you will get wet.",4

They also have a nice beer list, and the server I had was super friendly,",3

This place gets three stars only because it was pretty, i got in for free, and the bartender was pretty nice.",2
12358,"So to begin with, overall, I do like this hotel. The accommodations are okay, the casino is alright, and the eateries are pleasant. Here's the big HOWEVER: IF YOU EVER LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES OR IN THE BELL HOP AREA, LOCK YOUR BAGS!! My boyfriend and I vacationed there May 1-3, and when we checked out, our baggage went to bell hop because our flight wasn't leaving for another 12 hours. When we got back home in Honolulu, we found some personal items (brand spanking new!!) MISSING!! I called the hotel and TWO weeks later, they are still giving me the run around about how to go about filing this complaint. Initially, they allowed me to file a complaint and i got a report number. Then they said call the RISK MANAGEMENT office (which I don't think exists!!) to follow up. I have called the office EVERY SINGLE day and EVERY SINGLE time it goes to voice mail, saying they are busy or away from the desk. They must be playing all day cause cant get them to answer ONCE. When I brought this up to a manager (about how i cannot get a hold of the RISK MANAGEMENT), they said \""oh, they must be backed up.\"" WAIT. That's the last thing I want to hear: That they have SO MANY report complaints that they re backed up. WTH. So, I call front desk, and i end up talking to several different managers saying they'll get back to me. THEY NEVER DID. I asked to be connected to an actual speaking person from the Risk Management office, and the managers say they cant connect me (How sketchy is this?!) Then just recently, the manager said they don't even have my report number. THAT WAS IT: I'VE HAD IT UP TO **HERE**. Its very frustrating because as paying guests, we should get the treatment and respect, and so far, the only thing I've walked away with is that THE ENTIRE CORPORATION DOESN'T CARE. They haven't called me back since, they haven't offered to take care of some of the expenses. I wanted to share this HORRIBLE experience over yelp because I don't think anyone else should have to experience this. By the way, if you ask to speak to a manager, don't even bother (I'd put their name on here, but I don't do threats). Yeah that's right, I just called you out.",0
49481,"This bar is somewhat of a sexy situation. With a greenlit entrance that makes you feel like you're entering somewhere slightly forbidden (or maybe Oz) and a mysterious pineapple logo...it'll definitely lure you in.

Place was a lil' empty, but I imagine it's great on happening nights too. Definitely hit up MN for a sultry and chill time!",3
6163,"OK, what is everyone else seeing here that I didn't? Yeah, I went for a weekday lunch instead of for Sunday brunch but shouldn't it still be at least a good experience? On the plus side, the physical space is special - lots of exposed brick, high ceilings, worn wood floors, lots of windows for natural light. The restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a Wednesday. It is definitely NOT handicapped accessible. The only access to the space is a very long, very steep flight of stairs. (Even the server told us that cases of food, wine and beer kegs have to be lugged up those stairs, there isn't even a freight elevator in the building.) I ordered the potato bisque (a menu staple) and the chef salad special. Our server forgot my soup and brought it out after she'd served my entree salad. The meats in the salad seemed like cold cuts - in fact, rather than being served julienned or chopped in the salad, they were simply layered on - rounds pieces of cold cuts in the salad! The ranch dressing was likely homemade but was runny in texture and bland in flavor. My chocolate cake dessert was okay - but not $7 worth of okay. My companion enjoyed the crab cake on top of an otherwise ordinary looking salad and she raved about the tiramisu. Our server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection. She brought out two bottles, let my aunt try both and make a selection. She even let the unchosed sample stay on the table instead of quickly whisking it back to the bar. Parking is a private lot off of South Blvd - but it's very easy to miss the entrance to the parking lot - and once you miss it, you can't access it from any of the neighboring parking lots either! Maybe I'll try again with a Sunday brunch - but the experience will have to be world class amazing to erase my memory of this lunch.",1
29408,"Not impressed at all with Serendipity 3. I've been wanting to experience this place for quite sometime, I still have hope for the NY location. I met a few friends here on Saturday night for dessert. There were a couple people in line in front of us after 11p and we were sat within about 20-30 minutes. I ordered the carrot cake and smores hot chocolate. The carrot cake was nothing special at all. HUGE, yes - tasty NO. The smores hot chocolate was pretty good the toasted marshmallows were good, but I LOVE marshmallows so that's an easy to please right there. The graham crackers were good and sort of smushy in the cup and I think it had chocolate kisses in it. It was ok. I also shared a frozen Oreo hot chocolate with me friend. It's not something I ever need to try again. The decor of this place is also awful in my opinion. It was about 30 degrees outside so the thing Serendipity did have going was the heat - it felt about 100 degrees in there. I didn't try any of the meals but I certainly wouldn't go for this type of meal if on the strip with the other selections. Our server was very nice and we actually closed the place down - it must have been after 1A when we left.",1
39267,"This place is a little different. The food is prepaird by world class chefs, but the portions are extremely small, and I mean small. I paid $15.00 dollars for mushrooms. They were good but come on give me a break here. Extremely over priced. One of the thing that I think is weird is that they have a banner hanging outside that says \""Voted best entertainment\"" by owners. Why would a business put that on their banner?",2
40048,"I usually come to Le Confessional on a Thursday night because it gets happening on Thursday nights. The drink prices are not cheap but not exorbitant. The music is very diverse (from house to hip hop). The crowd is also a reflection of the music, diverse. On my most recent visit, I was disappointed with the coat check process. It took a long time to get my coat, plus they handed me 4 wrong umbrellas until the right one was finally handed to me. However, It was the only blemish on that night. Overall, Le Confessional is a place you want to start your evening off, not where you stay the whole night.",2
30927,"Its selection needs improving, but it's the only bookstore at Town Square so you have to make do. Don't get me wrong, this Borders is new, clean and usually very lively. But if you're looking for a bookstore with a greater selection, try the Barnes & Noble on Stephanie near the galleria mall. When it comes to bookstores in Las Vegas, your choices are almost strictly limited to Borders or Barnes & Noble. With all the suburban sprawl, new clean looking chain stores rule. This is far from a quaint college town with smaller, independent bookstores... so you'll have to accept it for what it is. This Borders opened up within the past year or two. It regular has visits and signings by authors, some of them more famous than others. A few pluses would be plenty of search stations to find books you want. Another is that there is a Seattle's Best Coffee Cafe inside the store. Also, there are frequent book drives to help out local schools and community organizations to help get kids reading. How can you possibly say no to that upon checkout?! But the thing that only gets this place 3 stars is the limited selection. Especially when it comes to the two shelf film section. Oh but if you're into the \""young adult teen vampire obsession\"" genre, there's plenty of that. So yeah, if you're looking for something well known and relatively new this place will do. If you're into something a little more obscure, or just want to browse, maybe not.",2

Don't be fooled by the fact that it's vegan and vegetarian, the food is as good as, if not better than its meat filled counterparts. I'm mad that I'm not eating there right now.

48569,"Decided to give this place another chance after a terrible experience last time I visited the previous location. The new building had a funky odor going on inside so we opted for patio seating. As soon as we sat ourselves at one of the 7 open tables we were approached my a manager saying that we had to wait to be seated by the hostess. Upon mentioning all the vacant tables he told us that they were in the process of \""tracking down\"" those people to seat them. So we stood up and lingered until we were given permission to sit back down at the same table. The table side guac was great but the server never returned to take our order for entrees. We finally flagged down the manager who apologized and began taking our order until the server ran over to relieve him of her duty. He then told her how embarrassed he was for having to do that...awkward. We then continued to wait for our food for 30 minutes before I finally called the manager over again and told him they obviously forgot our order somewhere and we wanted to leave. For the negative experience he comped us a round of cheap girly shots (Washington apples or something) and presented the rest of the $25 bill.",0

Where are the elaborate chocolate displays and demonstrations? Where are the artisians? The enthusiasts? The chocoholics? All I saw were ridiculous lines of people waiting to pay too much for your basic fair food in which some of it was dipped in chocolate. BFD. Maybe it was the best chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick ever, but I will never know because I'm not waiting any longer than 15 minutes to find out. Next time, I'm just going to head down the Central Phoenix Farmer's Market where I can give my money to local folks who are passionate about their craft and are fantastic at what they do. (Bite Me Brownies, Wei of Chocolate, etc.) I won't have to wait in line longer than It's a Small World at Disney for some crappy apple dipped in chocolate. Thankfully, we didn't bring the dogs as they would've been trampled and I feel sorry for the people who had their little ones in strollers because they were like salmons swimming upstream. I overheard one dad say that he had had enough. He was taking the stroller back to the car and just carry the baby. On a positive note, the entertainers were good for the time I was there and I found the little area shops charming.",0
6123,How bad is it when you don't want to go to Target? The issue I have with this Target location is the crowd capacity. Every weekend it's like Christmas shopping season. You can see the packed parking lot from 51. I personally would rather go to 3 different stores in less crowded areas then go to this target on a weekend. In fact I have driven out of my way to go to Wal-Mart in Indian Trail just so that I don't have to go to this Target. The designers should have doubled or expanded this location a long time ago and now with the addition of the fresh food department to the store I'm sure even more people will be shopping here.,1
6134,"Remember the days when you could watch a movie for $1? I don't, but I hear folks reminiscing about them. Old timer or not, Cinemark is the pretty decent place if you want to watch movies just out of rotation at the major theaters.Admission on the weekends is $2.25! During the week its only $2 and $1 on Tuesdays. Located behind the Krispy Kreme in Matthews (just look for the 'Hot' sign), the place looks like Pee Wee Herman's playhouse on the inside. But I can forgive that. They show movies generally two months after their original release date. Its your typical movie-fare, but occasionally they throw in an indie or foreign film. Look for the CineArts logo on the Showtimes page of the website. Please be forewarned however: the concession stand is NOT discount price. A large popcorn and drink runs $9. Also, if you're going on a Fri or Sat., there will be a lot of teens. They have cracked down on teen loitering in recent years, but certain teen-friendly movies might not be fun to watch on the weekend. However, Cinemark Matthews Movies makes a good cheap date or fills a boring weeknight. Netflix and Redbox watch out!",2
37907,"Jaleo suffers from what seemingly all Tapas places in the US suffer from. The whole idea of tapas is to try small portions of a number of different types of food at lower prices. Jaleo provides smaller portions but doesn't have as wide a variety of food as one would hope for and definitely doesn't have the lower prices. Jaleo then suffers from another problem - they fry just about every dish. Spanish food is not necessarily heavy or populated by fried items, but Jaleo's menu is just loaded up with fried options when it simply doesn't need to be. Even the datillos con tocino (dates with bacon - an absolute tapas staple) is fried. i've never seen that, why ruin the dish by frying it? Because of that maybe the best dish we had was the sliced apple and fennel salad - it was just so fresh and such a welcome, refreshing change. The other dish that was very good was the skirt steak with piquillo peppers - another common Tapas dish - that was done well. I love skirt steak so that helps as well since the steak was cooked well. So, yes, I've experienced better.",1
5212,Senator Harry Reid is a moron!!! That's it. -10 stars Update: I guess only one person here is aloud to have an opinion. Actually I was born and raised here in Las Vegas. So the fact that you are a die hard democrat makes my opinion uneducated. No the fact that Harry Reid puts so much time and effort into trying to get Yucca Mtn. stopped instead of embracing it is where I am coming from. So because of his continued fight to stop something that is unstop-able we are now not in control. Since it is not being used as it is supposed to the Fed Gov owes some $300 million per year for not fulfilling it's contract. ( wasting even more money ) If we had chosen to accept it we would have had the upper hand and demanded money for our roads and railways to be improved.

We got there around 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all... however, it took so long for our waiter to come by that we were about to get up and leave. He finally showed up, and I ordered the banana walnut pancakes with bacon while the fella ordered sausage and eggs over-well. To be fair, it IS called the Original Pancake House, so sausage and eggs probably aren't the way to go, but the fella got the driest-looking hockey puck sausages I've ever seen. His plate was just sad. My pancakes were good, but they just had a few slices of bananas and walnuts on top - it seemed odd considering most banana pancakes I've had had the bananas already in the batter. The bacon was solid. As we left, the place was pretty packed, so maybe the service gets better as they get busier? I won't be in a hurry to go back.",1

Jools Holland owns it- which gives it some credit I suppose, and it's nicely decorated inside but it's not my cup of tea. It seemed to be a playground for the over 50s looking to re-live their youth. It reminded me of dad dancing at a wedding - you know the sort. On several occasions, sweaty old men made their move towards me, at which point I hastily circled the room. Food-wise, it wasn't anything special either. I had pan-fried chicken without realizing it doesn't come with anything else, should have ordered sides.

You can't feel safe at all, and this whole area needs 15 times the police that are walking around. Price: Every time I turned around, someone wanted more money. Sure, there were displays of canned fruit and Elementary school artwork that's free to see, but anything else, and the carnies want more money. It would be a different thing, if they were cheap games with even cheaper prices, but they're not. These are cheap games with spendy prices. It's a groady, dirty, filthy place full of dirty, filthy workers that want me to hand over endless cash for their house-favored games. I'm proud to be an Arizona-born native, although I'm stunned that our politicians continue to declare that this annual event is a BENEFIT to the pride of the State of Arizona. Did I mention that they want money the INSTANT you park your car? They also WANT money when you go in, they WANT money for ride tickets, and they WANT money for food--- am I leaving something out? I would expect that they will start charging to use the CLEAN bathrooms that haven't been installed yet. Please avoid this place, save your money, and don't feel like you're missing anything. P.S. If you're going to a concert--- they will let you see it, once you've paid to get inside the park. It will be in the coliseum where the seats were designed for 12-year-old girls. Please don't expect that the seating was designed for actual, American men like John Wayne, who I heard was 6'4\"". He would've never fit. I'm also convinced that they won't spend the effort to correct this horrendously un-american flaw, and yet they will continue to expect your endless supply of $$$ money $$$. Enjoy!",0

17152,"DO NOT WANT I can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it's not service. Let me list our problems with our visit to this establishment: 1) Eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. The staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. Once we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. We discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. No apologies, no visits from the manager, no \""make ups.\"" 2) Dishonesty: While waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the rib eye was a 12-oz, while the rib eye a-la carte was 18-oz. That was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe. When the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. When we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. When we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond. 3) Food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. The spinach souffle is nasty. And having been to Mastro's, Ruths Chris, Lawry's, and Flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality.
